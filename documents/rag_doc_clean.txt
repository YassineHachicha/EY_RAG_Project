Introduction 
1. This document, together with the document 
Basel III: International framework fo r 
liquidity  risk measure ment, standards and monitoring
, presents the Basel Committee™s
1
 
reforms tostrengthenglobal capital andliquidity
 rules with the goalof promoting a more 
resilient banking sector.The objective of the refo rms is to improve the ba nking sector™s ability 
to absorb shocks arising from financial and ec
onomic stress, whatever the source, thus 
reducing the risk of spillover from t he financial sector to the real economy. This document 

sets out therules text and timelines to implement  the Basel III framework.  
2. The Commi ttee™s comprehensive reform package addresses the lessons of the 
financial crisis. Through its reform package, the Co mmittee also ai ms to improve ris k  
managemen t and governance as well as streng
then banks™ transparency and disclosures.
2
 
Moreover, t he reform packageincludes the Committee™s efforts tostrengthen the resolution 

of systemically significant cross-border banks.

3. A strong and resilient banking system is the foundation for sustainable economic  
growth, asbanks are at the centreof the cr
edit intermediation processbetween savers an d  
investors. Moreover, ba nks provide critical services to consumers, smal l and medium-sized 
enterprises, large corporate firms and government s who rely on them t o conduct their daily 

business, both at a domestic andinternational level.  
4. One of the  main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007,  
became so severe was that the banking sectors of man y countries had built up excessive on- 
and off-balance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual eros ion of thelevel and  

quality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks  were holding insufficient liquidity 

buffers. The banking system therefore was not 
able to absorb the resulting systemic trading 
and credit lossesnorcould it cope with thereintermediation oflarge off-balance sheet 

exposures that had built up in theshadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified 
by a procycl i cal deleveraging process and by t
he interconnectedness ofsystemic institutions 
through an array of complex trans actions. Duri ng the most severe episode of the crisis, the 
market lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The 

weaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial  system 

and the real economy, resulting ina massive cont
raction of liquidity and credit availability.  
Ultimately t he public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of liquidity, capital 

support andguarantees,exposing taxpayers to large losses.

5. The effect on banks, financial systems and economies at the epicentreof the crisis 
was immedi ate. However, the crisis also spread to a wider circle ofcountries around the  
globe. For these countries the transmission channels were less direct, resulting from a  

severe contraction in global liquidity, cro
ss-border credit availabili
ty and demand for exports. 
Given the scope and speed with which the recent and previous crises  have been transmitted 

around theglobe as well as the unpredictable nature of future crises, it is critical  that all 

countries rais e the resilience of their banking sectors to both internal and external shocks. 
6. To address the market failures revealed by the crisis, the Committee is introducing a 
number of fundamental reforms to the international regulatory framework. The reforms  

strengthenbank-level,or microprudential, regulation, whic h will helpraise the resilienc e of 

individual banking institutions toperiods ofstress. The reforms also have a macroprudential  

focus, addressingsystem-wide risks that canbuild up across the banking sectoras well as  
the procyclical amplification ofthese risks over time. Clearly these micro and 
macroprudential approaches tosupervision are interrelated, as greater resilience at the 

individual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks.  
A.  Strengthening the global capital framework 
7. The Basel Committee is raising the resilience of the banking sector by 

strengthening the regulatory capitalframework, building onthe three pillars of theBasel II 

framework. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and 
enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. They are underpinned by a leverage 
ratio that serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital measures, is intended to constrain 

excess leverage in the banking system and p rovide an e xtra layer o f protection against 

model riskand measurement erro r. Finally, t
he Committee is introducing a number of  
macroprudential elements into the capital framework to help containsystemic risks arising 

from procyclicality and from the interconnectedness of financial institutions.  
1. Raising the quality, co nsistenc y a nd transparenc y of the capital base 
8. 
It is critical t
hat banks™ risk exposure
s are backed by a high quality capital base. The 
crisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings, which 
is part of banks™ tangibl e common  equity bas e. It also revealed the i nconsistency in the  

definition of capital across juri sdictions and th
e lack of disclosure thatwould have enabled 
the market to fully assess and compare the quality of capitalbetween institutions. 
9. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common  shares and 
retained earnings. Thisstandard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be 

tailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold c omparable levels of 

high quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been  

harmonised internationally and generally appli
ed at thelevel of common equit y or its 
equivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainder of the Tier 1 capital base 

must be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary non-

cumulative dividends or couponsand have neither a maturity datenor an incentive to  

redeem. Inn ovative h ybrid capital instruments 
with an incentive to rede em through features 

such as step-up clauses , currently limited to 15 % of the Ti er 1 capital base, will be phased 
out. In addition, Tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonised and so-called Tier3 capital 
instruments, which were only available to cover market risks, eliminated. Finally, to improve 

market discipline, the transparencyof thecapita
l base will be  improved,
 with allelementsof  

capital required to be disclosed along with a detailed reconciliation to the reported accounts.

10. The Commi ttee is introducing these changes in a mann er that min i mises the 
disruption to capital instruments that are currently outstanding. It also continues to review the  
role that contingent capital should play in the regulatory capital framework. 
 
2. Enhancing risk coverage  
11. One of the key lessons of the crisis has been the need
 to strength
en the risk 
coverage of the capital framework. Failure to capture major on- and off-balance sheet risks, 
as well as derivative related exposures, was a key destabilising factor during the crisis .  
12. In responseto these shortcomings, the Committee in July 2009 completed a numbe r 
of critic al reforms to theBasel II framework. These reforms will raise capital requirements for 

the tradingbook and complex securitisation exposures, a major source of losses for many 

internationally active ba nks. The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk 

(VaR) capital requirement basedon a continuous 12-month periodof signifi cant financial 
stress. In addition, theCommittee has introduced higher capital requirements for so-called 
resecuritisati ons in both the banking and the trading book. The reforms also raise the  

standards of the Pillar 2supervisory review process andstrengthen Pillar 3 disclosures. The 

Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 enhancements must be i mplemented  by the end  of 2011; the Pillar 2 

standards became effective when they were introduced in July 2009.  The Committee is also 

conductinga fundament al review of  the trading book. The work on the f undamental review of 
the trading book is targeted for completion by yea r-end 2011. 
13. This document also introduces measures to strengthen the capital requirements for 
counterparty credit exposures arising from bank s™ derivatives, repo and securities  financing 

activities. These reforms will raise the capi tal buffers backing these exposures, reduce 

procyclicality and provi de additional incentivesto move OT C derivative  contracts to central  
counterparties, thus helping r
educe systemic risk acrossthe 
financial system. They also 
provide incentives to strengthen therisk 
management of counterparty credit exposures. 
14. To this end,the Committee is introducing the following reforms: 

(a) Going forward, banksmust determine their capital requirement for counterparty 
credit risk us ing stressed inputs. This will address concerns about capital charges 
becoming too low during periods ofcompressed market volatility and help address 
procyclicality. The approach, whichis simila
r towhat has been introduced for market  

risk, will al so promote more integrated management of market and counterparty 

credit risk.  
(b) Banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses (ie 
credit valuation adjustment Œ CVA Œ  risk) associated with a deterioration in the credit 
worthinessof a counterparty. While the Basel II standard covers the risk of a 
counterparty default, it does not address such CVA risk, which during the financial 

crisis was agreater source of lossesthan those arising from outright defaults.  
(c) The Commi ttee is strengthening standards for collateralmanagemen t and initial 
margining. Banks with large and illiquid derivative exposures to a counterparty will 
have to apply longer margining periods as a basis for determining the regulatory 
capital requirement. Add i tional standards have been adopted to strengthen collateral 

risk management practices.  
(d) To address the systemic risk arising from the inte rconnectedness of banks and other 
financial institutionsthrough the derivatives markets, theCommittee is supporting 

the efforts of the Commi ttee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the  

4 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
International Organization of Securiti es Commissions (IOSCO) to establish strong 
standards for financialmarket infrastructures,including central counterparties. The 
capitalisation of bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) will be based in  

part on thecomplianceof the CCP with such standards, and will be finalised aftera 

consultati ve process in2011. A bank™scollateral and mark-to-market exposures to 

CCPs meet ing these enhanced principles will be subjec t to a low ri sk weight, 

proposed at2%; and default fund exposures toCCPs will be subject torisk-sens itive  
capital requirements. These criteria,together with strengthened capital requirements 
for bilateral OTC deri v ative expos ures, will create strong incentives for banks to 

move e xpo sures to such CCPs. Moreover, t o addresssystemic risk within the 

financial sector, the Committee also is raising the riskweights onexposures to  

financial institutions  relative to the non-financial corporate sector, as financial 
exposures are more highly correlated than non-financial ones.  
(e) The Commi ttee is raising counterparty credit risk management standards in a  
number of a reas, including for the treatment of so-called wrong-way ris k , ie cases 
where the exposure increases when the credit quality of the counterparty 

deteriorates. It also issued final additional guidance for the sound backtesting of 

counterparty credit exposures. 
15. Finally, theCommittee assessed anumber of measures to mitigate the relianceon  

external ratings of the Basel II framework. Themeasures include requirements for banks to 

perform their own internal assessments of ex
ternally rated securiti sation exposures, the 
elimination of certain ﬁcliff effectsﬂassociated with credit risk mitigation practices, and the  

incorporation of key el ements of t he IOSCO 
Code of Co nduct Funda mentals for Credit  
Rating Agencies
into the Committe e™s eligibility criteria for the use of external ratings in the 
capitalframework. The Committee  alsoisconducting amore fundamental review of the  

securitisation framework , including its relianceon external ratings. 
3. Supplementing the risk-based capital requirementw itha leverage ratio 
16. 
One of the underlying features of the cr
isis was the build up of excessive on- an
d
 
off-balancesheet leverage in the banking system. The build up ofleverage alsohas been a 
feature of previous financial crises, for exampl e leading up to September 1998. During the 

most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its 

leverage in a manner th at amplified downward p r
essure on asset prices, further exa c erbating 
the positivefeedback loop between losses, declines in bank  capital, and the contraction in 

credit availability. The Committee th erefore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement that is 
intended toachieve the following objectives: 
 constrain leverage in t he bankingsector, thus helping to mitigate the risk of the 
destabilising deleveraging processes wh
ich can damage the financial system and  
the economy; and  
 introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by  
supplementing the risk-based measure with a simple, transparent, independent 
measure of risk.   
17. The levera ge ratio is calculated in a comparable ma nner across jurisdictions , 

adjusting for any differences in accounting standards. The Committe e has designed the 
leverage ratio to be a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based requiremen t with a  
view to migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment based on appropriate review and calibration.

4. Reducing proc yclicality and prom oting counterc yclical b uffers 
18. One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis  has been the procyclical 
amplification of financial shocks throughout  the banking system, financial marketsand the 

broader economy. The tendency of market parti
cipants tobehave in a procyclicalmanner 
has been amplified through a variety of channels, includingthrough accounting standards for 

both mark-to-market assets and held-to-maturity loans, margining practices, and through the 

build up and release of leverage among fina ncial institutions, firms, and consumers. The  
Basel Committee is introducing a number of measures tomake banks more resilient to such 
procyclicaldynamics. These measur
es will help ensure that the banking sector serves as a 
shock absorber, insteadof a transmitter of risk tothe financial system and broader economy.  
19. In addition to the leverage ratio discussed in the previous section, the Committee is 
introducinga series ofmeasures to addressprocyclicality and raise the resilience of the 
banking sector in good times. These measures have the following key objectives: 
 dampen any excess cyclicality of theminimu m capital requirement; 
 promote mo re forward looking provisions; 
 conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and thebanking sector that can  
be used in stress; and 
 achieve the broader macroprudential goal ofprotecting the banking sector from  
periods of excess creditgrowth. 
Cyclicality of the minimum requirement 
20. 
The Basel II framework increased the risk sensit
ivity and coverage of the regulatory 
capital requ
irement. Indeed, one ofthe most procyclicaldynamics hasbeen the failure of risk 
managemen t and capital frameworks to capture key exposures Œ such as complex trading 
activities, resecuritisations and exposures to of
f-balance sheet vehicles Œ in advance of the 
crisis. However, it is not possibl e to achieve gr
eater risk sensitivity across institutions at a 
given pointin time without introducing acertain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital 

requirements over time. The Committee was aware of this trade-off during the design of the 

Basel II framework and introduceda number of sa
feguards to addressexcess cyclicality of 
the minimum requirement. They include the requirement to use long term data horizons to 

estimate probabilities of default, the introduction of so called downturn loss-gi ven-default 

(LGD) estimates and the appropriate calibration of the risk functi ons, which convert loss  
estimates into regulatory capital requirements. The Committee also required that banks 
conduct stress tests that consider the downward migration of their credit portfolios in a  

recession. 
21. In addition, the Committee has put in plac e a comprehensive data collection  
initiative toassess the impact of the Basel II framework o n its memb er countries over the  
credit cycle. Should the cyclicality of the minimum requirement be greater thansupervisors 
consider appropriate, the Committee will cons ider additional measures to dampen such 

cyclicality.  
22. The Committee has reviewed a n umber of additional measures that supervisors 
could take to achieve a better balance between risk sensitivity and th e stability of capital 

requirements, should this be viewed as necessary. In particular, the range of possible 
measures includes an approach by the Committ ee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS) 
to use the Pillar 2 process to adjust for the compression of probability of default (PD) 

6

estimates in internal ratings-based (IRB) capitalrequirements during benign creditconditions 
by using the PD estimates for a bank™s portfolios in downturn conditions.
4
 Addressing the 
same issue, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) has  proposed an approachaimed at 
providing non-cyclicalPDs in IRB requireme
nts through the application of a scalar that 
converts the outputs of a bank™s underlying 
PD models intothrough-the-cycle estimates.
5
   
Forward lo oking provisioning 
23. The Committee is promoting stronger pr
ovisioning practices through three related
 
initiatives. F
irst, itis advocating achange in theaccountingstandards towards anexpecte d  
loss (EL) approach. The Committee 
strongly supports the initiative of the IASB to mo ve to an  
EL approach. The goal is to improve the usefulness and relevance of financial reporting for 
stakeholders, includingprudential regulators. It has issued publicly and made a vailable to the 

IASB a set of high level guiding principles that  should govern the reforms to the replacement  
of IAS 39.
6
 The Commi ttee supports  an EL approach that captures ac tual losses more  
transparently and is also less procyclical than the current ﬁincurred lossﬂ approach. 
24. Second, itis updating its supervisory guidance to beconsistent with the move to  
such an EL approach. Such guidance will assistsupervisorsin promoting strong provisioning 

practicesunder the desired EL approach. 
25. Third, it isaddressingincentives to stronger provisioning in the regulatory capital 
framework.  
Capital conservation 
26. 
The Committee is introducing a framework to 
promote the conservation of capital 
and the build-up of adequate buffer
s  above the minimu m that can be drawn down in periods 
of stress.  
27. At the onset of the fi nancialcrisis, a number of banks continued tomake large 
distributions in the form of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation 

payments even though their individual financial c ondition and the outlook for the sector were 

deteriorating. Much of this activity was 
driven by a collectiv
e action problem, where  
reductionsin distributions were perceived as sending a signal of weakness. However, these 
actions made individualbanks and the sector 
as a whole less resilient. Many ban ks soon 
returned to profitability but did not do enough to rebuild their capital buffers to support new 
lending acti vity. Taken together, thisdynamic has 
increasedthe procyclicality of the system. 
28. To addressthis market failure, theCommittee is introducing a framework that will 

give supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector. 

Implementat ion of the framework through internationally agreed capitalcons ervation 
standardswill help increase sector resilienc egoing intoa downturn and will provide the  
mechanism for rebuilding capital during the eco
nomic recovery. Moreo v er, the framework is

sufficiently flexible to allow for a rang e of supervisory and ba nk responses  consistent with the 
standard.   
Excess credit growth 
29. 
As witnessed during the financial crisis, losses incurred in t
he banking 
sector during  
a downturn precededby a period of excesscredi
t growth can be extremel y large. Such 
losses can destabilise the banking sector, which can bring about or exac erbate a downturn in  
the real economy. This in turn can furtherdestabilise the banking sector. These inter-
linkages hi ghlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up its capital 
defences in periods when credit has grown toexcessive levels. Thebuilding upof these 

defences should have the additionalbenefit of helping to moderate excess credit growth.  
30. The Basel Committee is introducing a regime which will adjust the capital buffer 
range, established through the capital cons ervation mechanism outlined in the previous  
section, when there are  signs that credit has grown to e xcessive levels. The purpose of the 
countercyclical buffer is to achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the 

banking sector in periods  of excessaggregate credit growth. 
31. The measures to address procyclicality are designed to complement each other. 
The initiatives on provisioning focus on strengthening the banking system against expected 

losses, while the capital measures focus on unexpected losses.Among the  capital 
measures, there is a di stinction between addressing thecyclicality of the minimum and  
building additional buffers above t hat minimu m. Indeed, strong capital buffers above th e  

minimu m requirement have proven to be critical, 
even in the absence ofa cyclical minimum.  
Finally, the requirement to address excess credit growth is set at zero in normal times an d  

only increases during periods of excessive credit availability. Howe ver, even in the absence 
of a credit bubble, supervisors expect the banking sector to build a bufferabove the minimum 
to protect itagainst plausibly severe shocks, which could emanate from many sourc es.  
5. Addressing s ystemic ri sk and interconnectedness 
32. 
 While procyc
licality
 amplified shocks over the time dimension, excessive 
interconnectedness among systemically important
 banks also transmitted shocks across the 
financial system and e c onomy. Systemically 
important ba nks shouldhave loss absorbing  
capacity beyond the mi nimum stan dards and the work on this issue is ongoing. The Basel 

Committee and the Financial Stability Board are developing a well integrated approach to 

systemically important financialinstitutions which could include combinations ofcapital 

surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt. As part of this effort, the Committee is 

developing a proposal on a methodology co
mprising both quantitative and qualitative 
indicators to assess the systemic importance of financial institutions  at a global level. The 

Committee is also conducting a study of the magnitude ofadditionalloss absorbency that 

globally systemic financial institutions  should hav
e, along wit h an assessment of the extent of  
going concern loss absorbency which could be provi ded by th e various proposed  

instruments. The Co mmittee™s analysis has also covered fu rther measu res to mitig ate the 
risks or externalities associated with systemic
 banks, including liquidity surcharges, tighter 
large exposure restrictions and enhanced supervision. Itwill continue its workon these 
issues in the first half of 2011 in accordance with the processes and timelines set out in the 

FSB recommendations.  
33. Several of t he capital requirements introduced by the Co mmittee to mitigate the  
risks aris ing from firm-l evel exposures among gl
obal financial institutions will also help to 
address systemic risk and interconnectedness.These include: 

8 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
 capital incentives for banks to use centralcounterparties for over-the-counter 
derivatives;  
 higher capital requirements for trading and derivative activities, as wellas complex 
securitisations and off-balance sheet exposures (eg structured investment vehicles); 
 higher capital requirements for inter-financialsector exposures; and  
 the introduction of liquidity requirement
s thatpenalise excessive reliance onshort  
term, interbank fundingto support longer dated assets.  
B. Introducingaglobal
 liquidity standard  
34. Strong capital requirements are anecessary condition forbanking sector stability 
but by themselves are not sufficient. A strong liquidi ty base reinforced through robust 

supervisory standards is of equal impor
tance. To date, however,  there have been no 
internationally harmonis ed standards in this  area. The Basel Committee is therefore 

introducing internationally harmonised global li quidity standards. As with the global capital 

standards, the liquiditystandards will establishminimu m re quirements and will promote an 

international level playing field to help pr
event a competitive race to the bottom. 
35. During the early ﬁliquidi ty phaseﬂ of 
the financial crisis,many bank s Œ despite 
adequate capital levels Œ still experienced difficulties  because they did not manage their 

liquidity in a prudent ma nner. The crisis again dr
ove home t he importance of liquidity to the  
proper functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. Prior to the crisis, asset 

markets were buoyant a nd funding was readily available at low cost. The rapid reve rsal in 

market conditionsillustrated how quickly liquidity can evaporate and thatilliquidity can last for 

an extende d period of time. The  banking system ca me under severe stress, which 
necessitated central bank action to support both the functioning of money markets  and, in  
some cases, individual institutions . 
36. The difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basicprinciples  of 
liquidity risk manageme n t. In re
sponse, as the foundation of its liquidity framework, the 
Committee in 2008 published 
Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management an d  
Supervision
.
7
 The Sound  Principlesprovide detailed guidance on the risk management an d  
supervision of funding liquidity risk and should help promot e better risk manage me nt in this 

critical  area, but onlyif there is full impl
ementati on by banks andsupervisors. Assuch, the 
Committee will coordi nate rigorous follow up by supervisors to ensurethat banksadhere to 

these fundamental principles.  
37. To complement these principles, the Committee has further strengthened its liquidity 
framework by developi ng two 
mi n i mu m
 sta ndards for funding liquidity. An additional 
component of the liquidity framework is aset 
of monitoringmetrics toimprove cro ss-border 
supervisory consistency.  
38. These standards have b een developed to ac
hieve two separate but complementary 
objectives. The first objective is to promote s hort-term re silienc e of a bank™s liquidity risk 
profile by e nsuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive a n acute 
stressscenario lastingfor one month. The Committee developed the LiquidityCoverage  

Ratio (LCR) to achievethis objec tive. The seco
nd objective is to promote resilience over a

longer timehorizon by creating additi onal incentives for a bank to fund its activities with more 
stable sources of funding on an ongoing structural basis. The Net Stable Funding Ratio 
(NSFR) has  a time horizon of oneyear and has been developed to provide a sustainable 

maturity structure of assets and liabi lities. 
39. These two standards are compri sed mainly of spec ific parameters which are  
internationally ﬁharmonisedﬂ with pre scribed 
values. Certain parameters contain elements of 
national discretion to reflect jurisdiction-specific conditions. In these cases, the parameters 
should be transparent and clearly outlined in the regulations  of each jurisdicti on toprovide 
clarity bothwithin the jurisdicti on and internationally.  
1. Liquidity Coverage Ratio  
40. 
The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liqui
dity disruptions over 
a  
thirty day h orizon. It will help ensure that global banks have sufficientunencumbered, high-
quality liquid assets to offset the net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute short-
term stress scenario. The specifiedscenario is
built upon circumstances experienced in the 
global financ ialcrisis that began in 2007 andentails both institution-specific andsystemic 

shocks. The scenarioentails asignificantstress, albeitnot a worst-case scenario, and 

assumes the following: 
 a significantdowngrade of the institution™s publiccredit rating;  
 a partial loss of deposits; 
 a loss of unsecured wholesale funding; 
 a significantincrease insecured funding haircuts; and  
 increasesin derivative collateral calls and substantial callson contractual and non-
contractualoff-balancesheet exposures, including committed creditand liquidity 
facilities.  
41. High-quality liquid as sets heldin the stockshould beunencumbered, liquidin  

markets during a time of stress and,ideally, be central bankeligible. 
2. Net Stable Funding Ratio 
42. The NSFR requires a minimu m a m
ount of st
able sources of funding at a bank 
relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets,as well as the potential for contingent liquidi ty 
needs arising from off-balance sheet commitme nts
, over a one-year horizon. The NSFR aims  
to limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding during times of buo yant market liquidity 

and encourage better assessment of liquidity risk 
across all on- and off-balance sheet items.  
3. Monitoringtools 
43. At present, supervisorsuse a wide 
range of qu
antitative measures tomonitor the  
liquidity risk profiles ofbanking organisations as  well as across the financial sector, for a 
macroprudential approach to supervision. A survey of Basel Committee members co nducted 

in early 200 9 identified that more th an 25 different measures and concepts are used globally 

by supervisors. To introduce more consistenc y internationally, the Committee has developed 
a set ofcommon metrics thatshould be considered as the minimum types of information  
which supervisors should use. In addition, supervisors may use additional metrics in order to  

capture spec ific risksin theirjurisdictions
. Themonitoringmetrics include the following and 

10 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor

may evol ve  further as the Committ ee conducts further work . One area in parti cular where 
more work o n monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk.  
(a) Contractualmaturity mis match: To gain an understanding of the basic as pects of a 
bank™sliquidity needs, banks should frequently 
conducta contractual maturity mismatch 
assessment. This metric provides an initial, simple baseline of contractual commit ments and 

is usefulincomparing liquidity riskprofiles ac ross institutions , and to highlight to both banks 

and supervisors when potential liquidity needs could arise. 
(b) Concentration of funding: This metric involves analysing conc entrationsof wholesal e 
funding provided by specific counterparties, instruments and currencies. A metric  covering  

concentrations of wholes ale funding assists supervisors in assessing the extent to which 

funding liquidity risks could occur in the event that one ormore of the fundingsources are 

withdrawn. 
(c) Available unencumbered assets: This metric measures the amount of  
unencumbered assets a bank haswhich could potentially be used ascollateral for secured 

funding either in the market or atstandingcentral bank facilities. This  should make banks 

(and supervisors) more aware of th eir potential capacity to raise additional secured funds,  

keeping inmind that in a stressedsituation this ability may d ecrease.  
(d) LCR by currency: In recognition that foreign exchange risk is a component of 
liquidity risk, the LCR should also be assessed in eachsignificant currency, in order to 
monitor and manage the overall level and trend of currency exposure at abank. 
(e) Market-related monitoring tools: In order to have  a source of instantaneous data on  
potentialliquidity difficulties, us efuldata to m
onitor includesmarket-wide data on asset prices  
and liquidity, institution-related information such as credit default swap (CDS) spre ads and  
equity prices , and additional institution-specific  information related to the ability of the  
institution to fund itself in various wholesale funding markets and the price at which it can do 

so.  
C. T ran sition alarrang emen ts 
44. The Commi ttee is introducing transitional arrangements to implemen t the new 

standards that help ensure that the bankingsector can meet the higher capital standards 

through reasonable earnings retention and capital raising, while still supporting lending to the  
economy. T he transitional arrangements are described in the Basel III liquidity rules text 
document and summari sed inAnnex 4 of this document.  
45. 
 After an observation period beginning in 2011, the LCR will be introduced on 
1 
January 2015. The NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018. The
 
Committee will put in pl ace rigorous reportingprocesses to monitor the ratios during the 
transition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial 
markets, credit extension and economic gr
owth, addressing unintended consequences as  
necessary.  
46. Both the LCR and the NSFR will be subject to an observation period and will include 
a review clause to address any unintended consequences.

Part 1: Minimum capital 
requirements and buffers 
48. The global banking system entered the crisis with an insufficient level ofhigh quality 
capital. The crisis also revealed the inconsistency in the definition of capital across 
jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled the market to fully assess  
and compare the quality of capi tal ac rossjurisdictions. A key element of the new definition of 

capital is the greater focus on common equity,  the highest quality component of  a bank™s 

capital.

1. Common Equity Tier 1 
52.  Common Eq uity Tier 1 capital cons ists of the sum of the following elements: 
 Common s hares issued by the b ank that meet the criteria for classification as 
common sh ares for regulatory pu rposes (or the equivalent for non -joint stock 
companies); 
 Stock surplus (share premium) re sulting from the issueof instruments included 
Common Eq uity Tier 1; 
 Retainedearnings; 
 Accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclos ed reserves;
10
 
 Common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of thebank and held by third  
parties (ie minority inte rest) that meet the criteria for inclus ion in Common  Equity 
Tier 1 capital. See section 4 for the relevant criteria; and 
 Regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Commo n Equity Tier 1 
Retained earnings andother comprehensive income include interim profit or loss.National  
authoritiesmay consider appropriate audit, verification or review procedures. Dividends are  

removed fro m Co mmon  Equity Tier 1 in accordance with applicable accounting standards. 

The treatment of minority interest and the regulatory adjustments applied in the calcul ation of 

Common Eq uity Tier 1 are addressed in separatesections. 
Co mmon shares issuedby the bank 
53. 
 For an instrument to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 
capital it must meet all of 
the criteria t
hat follow. The vast maj ority of internationally active banks are structured as joint  
stock companies
11
 and for these banks the criteria must be met solely with commo n shares. 
In the rare cases wherebanks needto issue non-voting common shares as part of Common  
Equity Tier 1, they must be identical to voting common s hares of the issuing bank in all 
respects except the absence of voting rights.

Criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory capital  purposes
12
 
1. Representsthe most subordinated claim in liquidation of thebank. 
2. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets that is proportional with its share of issued 
capital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (ie hasanunlimited and  
variable claim, not a fixe d or cappedclaim).  
3. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (s etting aside  
discretionary repurchases or other means of effectively reducing capital ina 
discretionary manner th at is allowabl e under relevant law). 
4. The bank does nothingto create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will be 
bought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the 
statutory orcontractual terms provide  
any feature which might give rise tosuch an expectation. 
5. Distributions are paid ou t of distributable items (retained earnings included). The level 
of distributions is not inany way tie d or linked to the amount paid in atissuance and is 
not subjectto a contractual cap (except to the extent that a bank is unable to pay 

distributions that exceed the level of distributable items). 
6. There are no circumstances underwhich the distributionsare obligatory. Non payment 
is thereforenot an event of default. 
7. Distributions are paid o nly after all legal and contractual obligations have been met 
and payme nts on more  senior capital instruments have bee n made. Thi s means that 
there are no  preferential distributions , includingin respect of other elements classified 
as the highest quality issued capital. 
8. It is the issued capitalthat takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any 
losses as they occur
13
. Within thehighest quality capital,each instrument absorbs 
losses on agoing concern basis proportionately and 
pari passu
 with all the others. 
9. The paid in amount is recognised as  equity capital (ie not recognised as  a liability) for 
determining balance sheet insolvency. 
10. The paid inamount is classifiedas equity under the relevant accountingstandards. 
11. It is directly issued and paid-in and the bank can not directly or indirectly ha ve fund ed 
the purchase of the instrument.

11. Instruments classified as  liabilities for accounting purposes  must have principalloss 
absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an objective pre-specified 
trigger point or (ii) a write-down mechanism which allocateslosses to the instrumentat 

a pre-specified trigger point. The write-down will have the following effects: 
a. Reduce the claim of theinstrument in liquidation; 

b. Reduce the amount re-paid when a call is exercised; and 

c. Partially or fully reducecoupon/dividend payme nts on the instrument. 
12. Neither the bank nor a related party over wh
ich the bank exercisescontrol or signifi cant 
influence can have purchased the instrument, nor can the bank directly or indirectly 
have funded the purchase of the instrument 
13. The instrument cannot have any features 
that hinder recapitalisation, such as 
provisions that require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued 
at a lower price during aspecified time frame 
14. If the instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the holding company in t he 
consolidated group (eg a spec ial purpose vehicle Œ ﬁSPVﬂ), proceeds mustbe 

immediately available without limitation to an operating entity

The treatme nt of instruments issued out of consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and the 
regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital are addressed in separate  
sections. 
Instruments issued by  the bank thatmeet the Tier 2 criteria 
58. The objective of Tier 2 is to provide loss absorption on a gone-concern b
asis. Based
 
on this objective, the following box sets out the minimum s et of criteria for an instrument to 
meet or exc eed in order for it to be included in Ti er 2 capital.  
Criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital 
1. Issuedandpaid-in 
2. Subordinated to depositors and general creditors  of the bank 
3. Is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity or ot her 
arrangemen t that legally or economically enhan
ces theseniority of theclaim vis-à-vis 
depositors and general bank creditors  
4. Maturity: 
a.  minimu m original maturity of at leastfive years 
b. recognition in regulatory capital in the remaining five years before maturity will 
be amortised on a straight line basis 
c. there are no step-ups orother incentives to redeem 
5. May be callable at the initiative of the issuer only after a minimum of five years: 
a. To exercisea call option a bank must receive prior supervisory approval;  

b. A bank mu st not do a nything that creates an expectation that the ca ll will be 
exercised;
19
 and 
c. Banks must not exercise a call unless : 
i. They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better 
quality and the replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are 
sustainablefor the income capacity of the bank
20
; or 
ii. The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above  the minimu m 
capital requirements after the call option is exercised.
21
 
6. The investor must have no rightsto accelerate the repayment of future scheduled  
payments (coupon or principal), except in bankruptcy and liquidation.

dividend/coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banking  
organisation™s creditstanding. 
8. Neither the bank nora related party over which the bank exercises control or 
significant influence canhave purchased the instrument, nor can the bank directly or 

indirectly have funded the purchaseof the instrument 
9. If the instrument is not i ssued out of an operating entity or t he holding company in t he

criteria for inclusionin Tier 2 Capital 
 
Stock surplus (share premiu m) resulting from the issue ofinstru ments included in Tier2 
capital; 
59. Stock surplus (ie sharepremium) that is not eligible for inclus ion inTier1, will only 
be permitted to be included in Tier2 capital if the shares giving rise to the stock surplus are 

permitted to be includedin Tier 2 capi tal.  
General provisions /general loan-loss reserves (for banks using the Standardised Approach 
for credit risk) 
60. Provisions or loan-loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified losses
 
are freely available to 
meet losses which subsequently materialise and therefore qualify for 
inclusion within Tier 2.Provisions ascribed to identified deterioration of particular assets or 
known liabilities, whether individual or 
grouped, should be excluded. Furthermore,  general 
provisions/general loan-loss reserves eligible for inclus ion in Tier 2will belimited toa 

maxi mum of  1.25 percentage points of credit risk-weighted risk assets calculated under the 
standardised approach. 
Excess of total eligible provisions  under the Internal Ratings-based Approach 
61. 
 Where the total expected loss amount is less than total eligible provisions, as 
explained in
 paragraphs 380 to 383
 of theJune 2006 Comprehensive version of Basel II, 
banks may recognise the difference in Tier 2 capital up to a ma ximu m o f 0.6% of credit risk-
weighted assets calculated under the IRB approach. At national discretion, a limit lower than  
0.6% may b e  applied. 
4. Mi nority interest (ie non-controlling interest) and other capital issued out of 
consolidated subsidiaries that is held by third parties 
Co mmon shares issuedby consolidated subsidiaries 
62. 
 Minority interest arising from the issue of common shares by
 a fully co
nsolidated 
subsidiary of the bank may receive recognition in Common Equity T i er 1 only if: (1) the 
instrument giving rise to the minority interest would, if issued by the bank, meet all of the

23, 
24
 The amount of minority interest 
meeting the criteria above that will be recognis
ed in consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 will 
be calculated as follows: 
 Total minority interestmeeting the two criteria above minus the amount of the 
surplus Common  Equity Tier 1 of the subsidiary attributable to the minority 
shareholders. 
 Surplus Common  Equity Tier 1 of th e subsidiary is calcul ated as the Common  Equi t y  
Tier 1 of the  subsidiary minus the lower of: (1) t he minimu m Common Equity Tier 1  

requirement of the subsidiary plus the capitalconservation buffer (ie 7.0% of ris k  

weighted assets) and (2) the portion of the consolidated mini mum Co mmon Equit y  
Tier 1 requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (ie 7.0% of consolidated risk 
weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary. 
 The amount  of the surplus Common  Equity Tier 1 that is attributable to the minority 
shareholders is calcul ated by multiplying the surplus Common Equity Ti er 1 by th e  

percentageof Common Equity Tier 1 that is held by minorit y shareholders.  
Tier 1 qualifying capital issued byconsolidatedsubsidiaries  
63. 
Tier 1 capital instruments issued by a fully consolidated 
subsidiary of the bank to 
third party i
nvestors (including amounts under paragraph 62) ma y re ceive recognition in 
Tier1 capital only if the instruments would, if issued by the bank, meet all of thecriteria for 
classification as Tier 1 capital. Theamount of this capital that will be recognised in Tier 1 will  

be calculated as follows: 
 Total Tier 1of the subsidiary issued to third parti es minus the amount of the surplus 
Tier 1 of the subsidiaryattributable to the third party investors. 
 Surplus Tier 1 of the subsidiary iscalculated as the Tier 1of the subsidiary minus  
the lower of: (1) the mi nimum Tier 1 requirement of the subsidiary plus  the capital 
conservation buffer (ie 8.5% of risk weighted assets) and (2) the portion of the 
consolidated  minimum Tier 1 requirement 
plus the capital conservation buffer (ie 
8.5% of cons olidated risk weightedassets) thatrelates to the subsidiary. 
 The amount of the surplus Tier 1 that is attributable to the third party investors is 
calculated by multiplying the surplus Tier 1 by t he percentage of Tier 1  that is held 
by third party investors. 
The amount of this Tier 1 capital that will be recognised in Additional Tier 1 will exclude 

amounts recognised in Common Equity Tier 1 under paragraph 62.

Tier 1 and Ti er 2 qualifying capitalissued by cons olidatedsubsidiaries  
64. Total capital instruments (ie Tier 1 a nd Tier 2 ca pital instruments) issued by a fully 
consolidated subsidiary of  the b ank to third party in vestors (including amo unts under 

paragraph 62 and 63) may receive recognition in Total Capital only if the instruments would, 

if issued bythe bank, meet all of the criteria for 
classification as Ti er 1or Tier 2 capital. The 
amount of this capital that will be recognised in consolidated Total Capital will becalculated 

as follows: 
 Total capi tal instruments of thesubsidiary issued to third parties minus the amount 
of the surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary
 attributable to the third party investors. 
 Surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary is calculated asthe Total Capital of the 
subsidiaryminus the lower of: (1) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the 
subsidiary pl us thecapital conservation buffer (i e 10.5% of risk weighted assets ) 
and (2) theportion of the consolidated minimum Total Capital requirement plus the 

capital conservation buffer (ie 10.5% of consolidated risk weighted assets) that 

relates to the subsidiary. 
 The amount of the surplus Total Capital that is attributable to the third party 
investors iscalculated by multiplying  the surplus Total Capital by the percentage of 

Total Capital that is held by third party investors. 
The amount of this  Total Capital that will berecognisedin Tier 2 will exclude amounts 

recognisedin Common  Equity Tier 1 underparagraph62 and amounts recognised in 

Additional Tier 1 under paragraph 63. 
65. Where capital has been issued to third parties out of a special purpose vehicle 
(SPV), none  of this capital can be included in Common  Equ i ty Tier 1. However, suc h capital 
can be included in consolidated Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 and treated as if the bank itself 
had issued the capital directly to the third parties only if it me ets all the relevant entry criteria 

and the only asset of the SPV is its investment in the capital of the bank in a form that meets 

or exceeds all the relevant entry criteria
25
 (as required by criterion 14 for Additional Tier 1  
and criterion 9 for Tier 2). In cases where the capital has been issued to third parties through  

an SPV via a fully consolidated subsidiary of 
the bank, such capitalmay, subject to the 
requirements of this paragraph, be treated as ifthe subsidiary itself had issued it directly to  

the third parties and may be included in the bank™s consolidated Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 in 

accordancewith the treatment outlined in paragraphs 63 and 64. 
5. Regulatoryadjustments 
66. 
 This section sets out
 th
e regulatory adjustments to be applied to regulatory capital.  
In most cases these adjustments are applied inthe calcul ation of Common Equity Tier 1.  
Goodwill and other intangibles (except mortgage servicing rights) 
67. Goodwill and all other intangibles 
must be de
ducted in the calcul ation of Common  
Equity Tier 1, includingany goodwill included inthe valuation of significant investments in the 
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory 

consolidation. With the exception of mortgag e servicing rights, the full amoun t is to be 
deducted net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the

  Assets that relate to the oper ation of the SP V ma y b e

intangibleassets become i mpaired or derecognisedunder the relevant accounting 
standards.The amount to be deducted in respect of mortgage servicing rights is set out in 
the threshold deductions section below. 
68. Subject to prior supervisory approval , banks that report under local GAAP ma y us e  
the IFRS definition of intangible as sets to determine whichassets are classifi ed as  intangible 

and are thus required tobe deducted.  
Deferred tax assets 
69. Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability of the bank to be realised 
are to be deducted in th
e calculat
ion of Common Equity Tier 1. Deferred tax assets may b e  
netted withassociateddeferred tax liabilities (DTLs) only if the DTAs and DTLsrelate to 

taxes levied by the same taxation  authority and offsetting is permitted by the relevant  

taxation authority. Where these DT As relate to temporary differences (eg allowance for credit 
losses) theamount to be deductedis setout in the ﬁthreshold deductionsﬂ section below. All 
other such assets, egthose relatingto operating losses, such as the carry forward o f unused 

tax losses,or unused tax credits,are to be deducted in full net of deferred tax liabilities as 

described above. The DTLs permitted to be netted againstDTAs must exclude amounts that 

have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension 

assets, and must be allocated on a pro rata ba sis between DTAs subject to the threshold 
deduction treatment and DTAs that are to be deducted in full. 
70. An overinstallment of tax or, in some jurisdictions, current year tax lossescarried 
back to prior years may give rise to a claim orreceivable from the government or local tax 

authority. Such amounts are typically classifi ed as current tax assets for accounting 

purposes. The recovery of such a claim or receivable would not rely onthe future profitability 
of the bankand would be assigned the relevant sovereign risk weighting. 
Cash flow hedge reserve 
71. 
 The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve that relates to t
he hedging 
of items that 
are not fair valued on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be  
derecognised in the calculation of Common Equ i
ty Tier 1. This means that positiveamounts 
should be deducted and negative amounts should be added back.  
72. This treatment specifical ly identifies the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that  
is to be derecognised for prudential purposes. It remo ves  the eleme nt that give s rise to 

artificial  volatility in common equity, as in this case the reserve only reflects onehalf of the 

picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not th e changes in fair value of the hedged future 

cash flow). 
Shortfall of the stock ofprovisions  to expected losses 
73. 
 The deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to
 
expected lo
sses underthe IRB approach should be made in the calculationofCommon  
Equity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and shouldnot be reduced by any ta x effects 
that could be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses. 
Gain on sale related tosecuritisation transactions 
74. Derecognise in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1
 any increa
se in equit y 
capital resulting from a securitisation transaction, such as that associated with expected  
future margin income (FMI) resulting in a gain-on-sale.
 

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems 
23
 
 
Cu mulative gains and losses due tochanges inown credit risk on fairvalued financial 
liabilities 
75. Derecognise in the calculation ofCommon Equity Tier 1, all unrealised gains and  
losses thathave resulted from chan ges in the fair value of l i abilities that are due to changes 

in the bank™s own credit risk. 
Defined benefit pensionfund assetsand liabilities  
76. Defined benefit pension fund li
abilit
ies, as included on thebalancesheet, must b e  
fully recognised in the calculationof Common E
quity Tier 1 (ie Common  Equity Tier 1 cannot 
be increased through derecognising theseliabilities). For each defined benefitpension fund 
that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of 

Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be 

extinguished if the asset shouldbecome impaired or derecognised under the relevant 
accountingstandards.Assets in the fund to which the bank hasunres tricted and unfettered  
access can, with supervisory approval, offset the deduction. Such offsetting assets should be 

given the risk weight they would receive 
if they were owned  directly by the bank. 
77. This treatment addresses the concern that as sets arising from pension funds may 
not be capable of being withdrawn and used for the protection of depositors and other 

creditors ofa bank. The concernis that theironly value stems from a reductionin future  
payments into the fund.The treatment allows for banks to reduce the deduction of the asset 
if they canaddress thes e concerns and show 
that the assets can beeasily andpromptly 

withdrawn from the fund. 
Investments in own shares (treasurystock) 
78. 
 All of a bank™s investments in its own common shares, whether held directly or 
indirectly, will be deducted in the calculation
 
of Co
mmo n Equity Ti er 1 (unless already 
derecognised under the relevant accounting standards). In addition, any own stock which the 
bank couldbe contractually obliged to purchas e should be deductedin the calcul ation of 

Common Equity Tier 1. The treatment described will apply irrespectiveof thelocation of the 

exposure in the bankingbook or the trading book. In addition: 
 Gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions  in the same underlying  
exposure only if the short positions  involve no counterparty risk. 
 Banks should look through holdingsof index securities to deduct exposures to own 
shares. However, gross long positi ons in own shares resulting from holdings of 
index securities may be netted against short positionin own shares resulting from 
short positions in thesame underlying index. In such cases the short positions ma y 

involve counterparty risk (which will be subjec t to the relevant counterparty credit  

risk charge). 
This deduction is necessary to avoi d the double counting of a bank™s own capital. Certain 

accounting regimes donot permit the recognition of treasury stock and so this deductionis  
only relevant where recognition onthe balance 
sheetis permitted. The treatment seeks to 
remove the double counting that arises from direct holdings,indirect holdings via index funds 
and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares.  
Following the same approach outlined above, banks mustdeduct investments in their own 
AdditionalTier 1 in the calculation of their Additional Tier 1 capital and must deduct  
investments in their own Tier 2 in the calculationof their Tier2 capital. 

24 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
Reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of banking, financialand insuranc e entities 
79. Reciprocal cross holdings of capital that are designed to artificially inflatethe capital 
position ofbanks willbe deducted in full. Banks mustapply a ﬁcorresponding deduction 

approachﬂ to such investments in the capital of other banks, other financial institutions and 

insurance entities. Thismeans the deduction should be applied to thesame comp onent of 

capital for which the capi tal would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself.  
Investments in the capital of banking, financialand insuranc e entities that are outside the 
scope of regulatory consolidation and where the bank does n
ot own 
more  than 10% of the 
issued common share capital of theentity  
80. The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the 
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory 

consolidation and where the bank does not ownmore than 10% of the issued common share 
capital of the entity. In addition: 
 Investments include direct, indirect
26
 and synthe tic holdings of capital instruments. 
For exa mple, banks should look through holdings of index securitiesto determin e  
their underlying holdings of capital.
27
 
 Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital 
includes common stock and all other types of
 cash andsyntheticcapital instruments 
(eg subordinated debt). It is the net long position that is to be included (ie the gross 

long position net of sh ort positions  in the same underlyi ng exposure where th e 

maturity of the short position ei thermatches the maturity of the long position orhas 
a residual maturity of at least one year). 
 Underwriting positions held for fi ve working days or less can be excluded. 
Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.  
 If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank hasinvested does not meet 
the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Ti er 2 capital of the bank, 
the capital is to be cons idered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory 

adjustment.
28
 
 National discretion applies to allow banks, with prior supervisory approval, t o  
exclude temporarily certain investments 
where these have been made in the context 
of resolvingor providing financial as sistance to reorganise a di stressedinstitution. 
81. If the total of all holdings listed above in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank™s 

common equity (after applying all other regulatory 
adjustments in full listed prior tothisone) 
then the amount above10% is required to be deducted, applying a corresponding deduction 

approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of capital for 

which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank  itself. Accordingly, the a mount to 

be deducted from common equity should becalculated as the total of all holdi ngs which in 

aggregate exceed 10% of the b ank™s common equity (as per a bove) multiplied by the

common eq uity holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings.This would result in a  
common eq uity deduction which corresponds to the proportion of totalcapital holdings held 
in common equity. Similarly, the amount to be d
educted from Additional Tier 1capital should 
be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank™s 

common eq uity (as per above) mu ltiplied by the Additional Tier 1 capital holdings as a 

percentageof the total capital holdings. Theamount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital 

should becalculatedas the total ofall holdi ngswhich in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank™s 
common eq uity (as per above) multi plied by the Tier 2 capital holdingsas a percentage of 
the total capital holdings. 
82. If, under the corresponding deducti on approach, a bank is required to makea 
deduction from a particu lar tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to 

satisfy that deduction, the shortfallwill be deducted from th e next highe r tier of capital (eg if a 
bank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capi tal to sati sfy the deduction, the shortfall will 
be deducted from Co mmon Equity Tier 1).   
83. Amounts b elow the th reshold, which are not deducted, will continue to be risk 
weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated asper the market risk rules 

and instruments in thebanking book should be treated as  per the internal ratings-based 

approach or the standardised approach (as applicable). Forthe application of risk weighting 
the amount of the holdings must be allocatedon a pro rata basis between those below and  
those above the threshold.

84. The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the 
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory 
consolidation where the  bank owns more  than 10% of the issued common share capital of 

the issuingentity or where the entity is an affiliate
30
 of the bank. In addition: 
 Investments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For 
example, ba nks should look through holdings
 of index securities to determine their 
underlying holdings ofcapital.
31
 
 Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital 
includes common stock and all other types of
 cash andsyntheticcapital instruments 
(eg subordinated debt). It is the net long position that is to be included (ie the gross 
long position net of sh ort positions  in the same underlyi ng exposure where th e 
maturity of the short position ei thermatches the maturity of the long position orhas 

a residual maturity of at least one year).

 Underwriting positions held for fi ve working days or less can be excluded. 
Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.  
 If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank hasinvested does not meet 
the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Ti er 2 capital of the bank, 
the capital is to be cons idered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory 
adjustment.
32
 
 National discretion applies to allow banks, with prior supervisory approval, t o  
exclude temporarily certain investments 
where these have been made in the context 
of resolvingor providing financial as sistance to reorganise a di stressedinstitution. 
85. All investme nts included above that  are not common shares must be  fully deducted  
following acorresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied 

to the same tier of capital for which t he capital would qualify if it was issued by the  ba nk itself. 

If the bankis required to make a deduction from a particular tier of capital anditdoes not 
have enoug h of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from 
the next hig her tier of capital (eg if a bank does not have  e nough Additional Tier 1 capital to 

satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from Co mmon Equity Tier 1).   
86. Investments included above that are common shares will besubject to the threshold 
treatment described in the next section.  
Threshold deductions 
87. 
 Instead of a full deduction, the following items may each receive limited recognition
 
when calculating Common Equity Tier 1, with recognitio
n capped at 10% of the bank™s  
common eq uity (after the application of all regulatory adjustments set out in paragraphs 67 to 
85): 
 Significantinvestments in the common sh ares of unconsolidated financial  
institutions (banks, insurance and other financial entities) asreferred to in paragraph 
84; 
 Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); a nd 
 DTAs that arise from temporary diff erences. 
88. On 1 January 2013, a bank must deduct the amount by which the aggregate of the 

three items above exce eds 15% ofits common equi
ty component of Tier 1 (calculated prior 
to the deduction of thes e items but after application of all other regulatory adjustments 
applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1). The items included in the 15% 

aggregate limit are subj ect to full disclosure. As of 1 January 2018, the c alculation of the 15% 

limit will be subject to the following treatment: the amount of the three items that remains  

recognisedafter the application ofall regulatory adjustmen ts must not  exceed 15 % of th e  
Common Equity Tier 1 capital, calculated after all regulatory adjustmen ts. See Ann ex 2 f o r 
an example.   
89. The amount of the three items thatare not deducted in the calcul ationof Common  
Equity Tier 1 will be risk weighted at 250%.

Former ded uctions from capital 
90. The following items, whi c h under Basel II were d educted 50% from Tier 1 and 50% 
from Tier2 (or had the option of being deductedor risk weighted), will receive a 1250% risk 

weight: 
 Certainsecuritisationexposures; 
 Certain equity exposure s  under thePD/LGD approach; 
 Non-payme nt/delivery on non-DvP a nd non-PvP transactions; and 
 Significantinvestments in commercial entities. 
6. Disclosurerequirements 
91. 
 To help improve transparency of regulatory cap
i
tal andimprove market  discipline, 
banks are required to disclose the following:
 
 a full reconciliation of allregulatory capital elements back to the balancesheet in the 
audited financial statements; 
 separate disclosure of all regulatory adjustments and the items not de ducted from  
Common Eq uity Tier 1 according toparagraphs87 and 88; 
 a descripti on of all limits and minima, identifying the positive and negative elements 
of capital towhich the limits and minima apply;  
 a description of the main features of capital instruments issued;  
 banks which disclose ratios involving components of regulatory capital (eg ﬁEquity 
Tier 1ﬂ, ﬁCore Tier 1ﬂ or ﬁTangibleComm
on Equityﬂ ratios) must accompany suc h  
disclos ureswith a comprehensive explanation of how these ratios are calculated. 
92. Banks are also required to make available on their websites the full terms an d  
conditions of all instruments included in regulatory capital.The BaselCommittee will issue 

more detailed Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in 2011. 
93. During the transition phase banks are required to disclos e the specificcomponents  
of capital, including capital instruments and regulatory adjustments that are benefiting from 

the transitional provisions. 
C. Transitionalarrangements 
94. 
 The transitional arrangements for implementi ng the new standards will help to
 
ensure that the banking sector can meet the
 higher capital standards through reasonable 
earnings retention andcapital rais ing, while still supporti ng lending to the economy. T h e  
transitionalarrangemen ts include:  
(a) National implementation by me mber countries will begin on 1 Ja nuary 2013 . 
Member countries must translate the rules intonationallaws and regulations before  
this date. As  of 1 January 2013, banks will be required to meet the following new 
minimu m requirements in relation torisk-weighted assets (RWAs): 
Œ 3.5% Common Equity Tier 1/RWAs;  

Œ 4.5% Tier 1capital/RWAs, and  

Œ 8.0% total capital/RWAs.  

28 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
(b) The minimu m Common  Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 requirements will be phased in  
between 1January 2013 and 1 January 2015. On 1 January 2013, the minimu m 
Common Equity Tier 1requirement will risefrom the current 2% levelto 3.5%. The  

Tier 1 capital requirement will rise from 4% to  4.5%. On 1 January 2014, banks will 

have to me et a 4% minimum Co mmon  Equit y Tier 1  re quirement a nd a Tier 1 

requirement of 5.5%. On 1January 2015, banks will have to me et the 4.5% 

Common Equity Tier 1 and the 6% Tier 1 requirements. The total capital 
requirement remains at the existing level of 8.0% and so does notneed to be 
phased in. The difference between the total capital requirement of 8. 0% and the  

Tier 1 requirement can be met with Tier 2 and higher forms of capital.  
(c) The regulatory adjustments (ie deductions and prudential filters), including amounts 
above the aggregate 15% limit for significant 
investments in financial institutions, 
mortgage servicing rights, and deferred tax assets from temporary differences, 

would be fully deducted from Co mmo n Equity Tier 1 by 1 January 2018.  
(d) In particular, the regulatory adjustments will begin at 20% of the required 
adjustments to Common  Equity Tier 1 on 1 January 2014, 40% on 1 January 2015,  

60% on 1 January 2016, 80% on1 January 2017, and reach 100% on 1 January 

2018. During this transition period, the remai nder not deducted from Co mmon  
Equity Tier 1 will continue to be subject to existing national treatments. The same  
transition approach willapply to deductions from AdditionalTier 1 and Tier 2 capital. 

Specifically, the regulatory adjustments to 
Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2  capital will 
begin at 20% of the required deductions on 1 January 2014, 40% on 1 January 

2015, 60%on 1 January 2016, 80% on 1 January 2017, and reach100% on 1 
January 2018. During this transitionperiod, the remainder not deductedfrom capital 
will continue to be subjec t to existing national treatments. 
(e) The treatment of capital issued out of s
ubsidiaries and held by third parties (e g 
minority interest) will also be phased in. Where such capital is  eligible for inclusion in 

one of the three components of capital according to paragraphs 63 to65, it can be  
included from 1 January 2013. Where such capital is not eligible for inclus ion in one 
of the three components of capital but is included under the existing national 

treatment, 2 0% of this amount should be ex
clud ed from the  relevant co mponent of  
capital on 1 January 2014, 40% on1 January 2015, 60% on 1 January 2016, 80% 

on 1 January 2017, and reach 100% on 1 January 2018. 
(f) Existing public sector capital injections will be grandfathered until 1 January 2018. 
(g) Capital instruments that no longerqualify as non-common  equity Tier 1 capital or 
Tier 2 capi tal will be phased out beginning 1January 2013. Fixing the base atthe  
nominal amount of such instruments outstanding on 1 January 2013, their 

recognitionwill be capped at 90% from 1 January 2013, with the capreducing by 

10percentage points ineach subs equent year
. This cap will be applied to Additional 
Tier 1 and Tier 2 separately and refers to the totalamount of instruments 

outstanding that nolonger meet the relevant entry criteria. To the extent an 

instrument is redeemed, or its recognition in capital is amortised, after 1 January 

2013, the nominal amount serving as thebase is not reduced.In addition, 

instrumentswith an incentive to be redeemed wi ll be treatedas follows:  
Œ For an instrument that has a call and a step-up prior to 1 January 2013 (or 
another incentive to be redeeme d), if the instrument is not called at its 
effective maturity date and on a forward-looking basiswill meet the new 

criteria for inclusion inTier 1 or Tie r 2, it will co ntinue to be recognised in that 

tier of capital.

Œ For an instrument that has a call and a step-up on or after 1 January 2013 (or 
another incentive to be redeeme d), if the instrument is not called at its 
effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis  will meet the new 

criteria for inclusion inTier 1 or Tie r 2, it will co ntinue to be recognised in that 

tier of capital. Prior to the effective maturity date, the instrument would be 

consideredan ﬁinstrument that no l onger qualifies as Additional Tier 1 or Tier 

2ﬂ and will therefore be phased out from 1 January 2013. 
Œ For an instrument that has a call and a step-up between 12 Septemb er 2010 
and 1 January 2013 (or another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument is 

not called at its effective maturity dat e and on a f orward looking basis does not 

meet the new criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will be fully 

derecognised in that tierof regulatory capital from 1 January 2013.  
Œ For an instrument that has a call and a step-up on or after 1 January 2013 (or 
another incentive to be redeeme d), if the instrument is not called at its 

effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis does  not meet the new 

criteria for inclusionin Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will be derecognised in that tier of 

regulatory capital from the effective maturit y  date. Prior to the effective 

maturity dat e, the instrument would 
be considered an ﬁinstrument that no 
longer qualifies as Additional Tier 1or Tier 2ﬂ and will therefore be phased out 
from 1 January 2013. 
Œ For an instrument that had a calland a step-up on or prior to 12 September 
2010 (or another incentive to be red eemed), if the instrument was not called at 

its effectivematurity date and on aforward looking basis does not meet the 
new criteriafor inclus ion in Tier 1 orTier 2, it will be cons idered an ﬁinstrument 
that no longer qualifiesas Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2ﬂ and will therefore be 

phased out from 1 January 2013. 
95. Capital instruments that do not meet  thecriteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier 

1 will be excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 as
 of 1 January 2013. However, in struments  
meeting the following three conditions will be phased out over the same horizon described in 

paragraph 94(g): (1) the y are issued by a  non-joint stock company
33
; (2) they are trea ted as 
equity under the prevailing accounting standards ; 
and (3) they receive unlimited recognition 

as part of Tier 1 capitalunder current national banking law. 
96. Only those instruments issued before 12 September 2010 qualify for the above  
transition arrangements.  
II. RiskCoverage 
A. Counterparty credit ris k  
97.
 
In addition to raising the quality and level of the capital base, there is a need to 
ensure that all material risks are captured in the capital framework. Failure to capture major 
on- and off-balance sheet risks, aswell as derivat
ive related exposures, was a key factor that 
amplified the crisis. This section outlines  
the reforms to thecounterparty credit risk 
framework, which become effective on 1 January 2013.

1. Revised metric to better address counterparty  credit risk, credit valuation 
adjustments and wron g-way risk 
Effective EPE with stressed paramet ers to address generalwrong-way risk 
98. 
In order to implement these changes, a new paragraph 25(i) will be inserted in 
Section V (Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum requirements), Annex 
4, of the Basel II framework and the existing paragraph 61 of Annex 4
 will be revised as 
follows forbanks withpermissionto use theinternal models method (IMM) to calculate 
counterparty credit risk (CCR) regula tory capitalŒ hereafter referred to as ﬁIMM banksﬂ: 
25(i). To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit riskas 
defined in paragraph 105, banks must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital 

charge (not including the CVA charge in paragraphs 97-104) based on Effective 

EPE using current market data and the portfolio-level capital charge based on  
Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress calibration should be a single 
consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties. The greater o f  

Effective EPE using current market data and
 the stresscalibration should not be  
applied on a counterparty by counterparty basis,but on a total portfolio level.  
61. When the Effective EPE model is calibra
ted using historic market data, the  
bank mustemploy current marketdata tocompute current exposuresand at leas t 
three yearsof historical data mustbe used toestimate parameters of the model. 
Alternatively, market imp lied data may be used to estimate parameters of the model. 

In all cases, the data must be  u pdated quarterly or more frequently if market  

conditionswarrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a stresscalibration, the 

bank mustalso calibrate Effective EPE us
ing three years of data that include a 
period of stress to the credit default spreads of a bank™s counterparties or calibrate  

Effective EPE using market impl ied data from a suitable period of stress. The 

following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stresscalibration: 
 The bankmust demo nstrate, atleast quarterly, that the stressperiod 
coincides with a period of increased CDS or oth er credit spreads Œ such as 

loan or corporate bond spreadsŒ for a representative selection of the 

bank™scounterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the 
bank doesnot have adequate credit spreaddata for a counterparty, the  
bank should map each c ounterparty to specific credit spread data based on 

region, internal rating and business types. 
 The exposure model for allcounterparties must use data, ei ther historic or 
implied, that include thedata from the stressed credit period, and must us e 

such data in a manner consistent with the method used forthe calibration 

of the Effective EPE mod e l to currentdata.  
 To evaluate the effectiveness of itsst
ress calibration for Effective EPE, the 
bank must create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the 

same main risk factors to which the bank isexposed. The exposure to 
these benchmark portfolios shall becalculated us ing (a)current positions  at 
current market prices,stressed volatilities, stressed correlations and other 

relevant stressed exposure model input
s from the 3-year stress periodand 

(b) current positionsat end of stress period market prices, stressed 

volatilities,stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure 
model inputs from the  3-year stress period. Supervisors may adjust the  
stresscalibration if theexposures of these benchmark portfolios deviate 

substantially.

Capitalisation of the riskof CVA losses  
99. To implement the bond equivalentapproach, the following new section VIII will be 
added to Annex 4 of t he Basel II framework. The new pa ragraphs (97 to 105) are to be 

inserted after paragraph 96 in Annex 4. 
VIII. Treatment of mark-to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital 
charge) 
-
 CVA Risk Capital Charge 
97. In addition to the default riskcapita
l requirements forcounterparty credit risk 
determined based on the standardised or internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches 

for credit risk, a bank must add a capital charge to cover t he risk of mark-to-market  

losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as c redit value  

adjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will becalculatedin  
the manner set forth below depending on the bank™s approved method of calculating  
capitalcharges for counterparty credit risk and specificinterest rate risk. A bank is 

not required to include in this capital charge (i) tran sactions with a central 

counterparty (CCP); and (ii)securities fi nancing transacti ons (SFT), unless their 

supervisordetermines that thebank™s CVA loss exposures arising from SFT  
transactions are material.

for bonds: Advanced CVA risk capi tal charge 
98. Bankswith IMM a pproval forcounterparty credit riskand approval to us e the 
market riskinternal models approach for thespecific interest-rate risk of bonds must 
calculate this  additional capital charge by mod elling the impact of changes in the 
counterparties™ creditspreads on the CVAs of all OTC derivative counterparties , 

together with eligible CVA hedges according to new paragraphs 102 and 103, using 

the bank™sVaR model for bonds.This VaR model is restri cted to changes in the 

counterparties™ credit spreads and does not mod el the sensitivity of CVA to changes 

in other market factors, such as changes in the value of the reference asset,  
commodity,  currency or interest rate of a deriva tive. Regard l ess of the accounting 
valuation method a bank uses for determining CVA, the CVA capital charge  

calculationmust be based on the following formula for the CVA of eac h

If the bank™s approved VaR model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit 
spreads (spread gamma), the gammas must b e calculated based on the formula in 
paragraph 98.  
Banks using the short cut method for collateralised OTC derivatives (paragraph 41  
in Appendix 4), must compute the CVA risk capital charge according to paragraph 

98, by assu ming a constant EE (e xpected exposure) profile, where EE is set equal  

to the effective expecte d positive exposure of t he shortcut method for a maturit y  

equal to the maxi mu m of (i) half of the longest maturity oc curring in the netting set

into the CVA risk capital charge,according to paragraph 98, unless the national 

supervisor decidesthatparagraph 104 should apply for thes e portfolios. Non-I MM 

netting sets are included into the ad vanced CVA risk capital charge by assuming a 

constant EE profile, where EE is set equal to the EAD as computed under CEM o r  
SM for a maturity equal to the maximum of (i) half of thelongest maturity occurring 
in the netting set and (ii) the notional weightedaverage ma turity of all transactions 

inside the netting set. The same approach applies where the IMM mod el does not  

produce anexpected exposure profile. 
For exposures to certai n counterparties, the bank's approved market riskVaR model  
may not refl ect the risk of credit spread changes appropriately, because the bank's 
market risk VaR mod el does not appropriately reflect the specific risk of debt 
instrumentsissued by the counterparty. For such exposures,the bank isnot allowed  

to use the advanced CVA risk charge. Instead, for these exposures the bank must 

determine the CVA risk charge by application of the standardisedmethod i n  

paragraph 104. Only exposures to counterparties for which the bank has 
supervisory approval for modelling the specificrisk ofdebt instruments are to be 
included into the advanced CVA risk charge. 
100. The CVA risk capital charge consists of both general and specific credit spread 
risks, including Stressed VaR but excluding IRC(incremental riskcharge). The VaR 

figure should be determi ned in accordance with the quantitative standards described 

in paragraph 718(Lxxvi ). It is thusdetermined as the sum of (i) the non-stressed 
VaR compo nent and (ii)the stressed VaR compo nent. 
i. When calcul ating the non stressed VaR, current parameter calibrati ons for 
expected exposure must be used. 
ii. When calculating the stressed VaR future counterparty EE profiles (according 
to the stressed exposure parameter calibrations as defined in paragraph 61 of  
Annex 4) must be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters 

34 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
should be the most severe one-year stress period contained within thethree-
year stressperiod usedfor the exposure parameters.
37
 
101. This additional CVA risk capital charge is the standalone market risk charge, 
calculated on the set of CVAs (as s pecified in paragraph 98) for all OT C derivatives  

counterparties, collateralised and uncollateralised, together with eligible CVA 
hedges. Within this standalone CVA riskcapital charge,no offset against other 
instruments on the bank™s balance sheet will be permitted (except as otherwise 

expressly provided herein).  
102. Only h edges used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk, and managed a s  
such, are eligible to be includedin the VaR model used tocalculate the above CVA 
capital charge or in the standardised CVA risk capital charge set forth in paragraph 
104. For example, if a credit default swap (CDS) referencing an issuer is in the 

bank™s inventory and that issuer also happens to be an OTC counterparty but the 

CDS is notmanaged as a hedge of CVA, then such a CDS is noteligible to offset 

the CVA wit hin the standalone VaR calculation of the CVA risk capital charge.  
103. The only eligible hedges that can be included in the calculation of the CVA risk 
capitalcharge under paragraphs 98 or 104 are single-name CDSs, single-name 
contingentCDSs, other equivalenthedging instruments referencing the counterparty  

directly, and index CDSs . In case ofindex CDSs, the following restrictions  apply: 
 The basisbetween any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of 
index CDS hedges must be reflected in the VaR. This  requireme nt also 
applies to cases where a proxy is u s ed for the spread of a counterparty, since 

idiosyncratic basis still needs tobe reflected insuchsituations .For all 
counterparties with no available spread, the bank must use reasonable basis 
time seriesout of a representative bucket of similar names for which a spread 

is available. 
 If the basis is not reflec ted to the satisfaction ofthe supervisor, then thebank 
must reflectonly 50% of the notionalamount of index hedges in the VaR. 
Other types of counterparty risk hedges must not be reflected within the calculation 

of the CVAcapital charge, and thes e other hedges mustbe treatedas any other 

instrument in the bank™s inventory f or regulatory capital purposes. Tranched or nth-

to-default CDSs are not eligible CVA hedges.Eligible hedges that are includedin 

the CVA capital chargemust be removed fro m  the bank™smarket riskcapitalcharge  
calculation. 
B. All other banks: standardised CVA risk capital charge
 
 
104. Whena bank does not havethe required approvals to use paragraph 98 to 
calculate aCVA capital charge for its counterparties, the bank must  calculate a 

portfolio capi tal charge us ing the following formu l a:

105. Calculation of the aggregate CCR and CVA risk capital charges 
This paragraph deals with the aggregation of the default risk capital charge and t he 
CVA risk capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses. Note thatoutstanding 

EAD referre d to in the default riskcapital charges below is net of incurred CVA 

losses according to [new paragraph after Para 9 in Annex4], which affects all items 
ﬁiﬂ below. In this paragraph, ﬁIMM capital chargeﬂ refers tothe defaultriskcapital 
charge for CCR based o n the RWAs obtained when multiplying the outstanding EAD 

of each counterparty under the IMM approach by the applicable credit risk weight 

(under the Standardised or IRB a pproach), and summin g across counterparties. 

Equally, ﬁCEM capital chargeﬂ or ﬁSM capita
l chargeﬂ refer to the default riskcapital 
charges where outstanding EADs for allcounterparties  in the portfolio are  

determined based on CEM or SM, respectively. 
 
A. Banks withIMM appro v al and market-riskinternal-models approval for the

The total CCR capitalcharge forsuch a bank is determined as the sum of the 

following components: 
i. The higher of (a)its IMM capital chargebased oncurrent parameter 
calibrations for EADand (b) its IMM capital chargebased onstressed 
parameter calibrations for EAD. Fo r IRB banks, the riskweights applied to 

OTC derivative expo sures should be calculated with the fullmaturity 
adjustment as a functi on of PD and M set equal to 1 inthe Basel Accord 
(paragraph 272), provided the bank can demonstrate to itsnational supervisor 

that itsspecific VaR model appliedin paragraph 98 contains effects of rating 

migrations. If the bank cannot demonstrate this to thesatisfaction of its

following components: 
i. The higher of (a) the IMM capit al chargebased oncurrent parameter 
calibrations for EAD and (b) the IMM capit al chargebased on stressed 
parameter calibrationsfor EAD. 
ii. The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined by paragraph 104. 
C. All other banks 
The total CCR capital charge forsuch banks is determined as the sum of the  
following two components: 
i. The sum over all counterpartiesof the CEM or SM based capi talcharge 
(depending on the b ank™s CCR approach) with EADs determined by 
paragraphs91or 69 respectively.  
ii. The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined by paragraph 104. 
In addition, the following paragraph will be inserted after paragrap h 9 in Annex 4. 
ﬁOutstanding EADﬂ for a given OT C derivative  counterparty is defined as the greater of zero 
and the difference between the sum of EADs across all netting sets with the counterparty 

and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which  has already been  

recognisedby the bank as an incurred write-down (ie a CVA loss). This CVA loss is 

calculated without taking into account any 
offsetting debit valuation adjustments which have  

been deducted from c apital under paragraph 75.
40
 RWAs for a give n OTC deri vative  
counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under theStandardised or IRB 

approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This reduction of EAD by 

incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital charge.  
Wrong-way risk 
100. Paragraph 57 of Annex 4 in Basel II will be revised as follows : 
57. 
Banks must identify exp

wrong-way risk. Stress testing andscenario analyses must be designed to identify

risk factorsthat are positively correlated 
with counterparty credit worthiness. Such 
testing needs to address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when 
relationships  between risk factors have  changed. Banks should mo nitor general 

wrong wa y risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are  

germane to  the business. Reports shoul
d be provided to senior management an d 
the appropriate committ ee of the Bo ard on a reg ular basis that communi cate wrong  
way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk. 
I mple ment a n explicit Pillar 1 capitalchar
ge andrevise Annex 4 where specific wrong-way 
risk has been identified 
101. 
In order to i mplement th e requireme nt that the EAD calculation reflect a higher EAD 
value for counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified, paragraph 423 of 
the Basel II text and paragraphs 29 and 58 of Annex 4 will be revised as follows: 
423. Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed mus t be separately 

rated. A b ank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the 
treatment of  individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under 
which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities.  

Those policies must include a proc ess for theidentification of specificwrong wa y 

risk for each legal entity to which th
e bank is exposed. Transactions with 
counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated 
differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 58, Annex 
4). 
29. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as 
the product of alpha times Effective EPE, asspecified below(except for 

counterparties that have  been identified as havin g explicit specific wrong wa y risk Œ  

see paragraph 58): 
58. A bank is exposed to ﬁspecific wrong-way ri skﬂ if future exposure t o a  
specific  counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty™s probability of 

default. Forexample, a company writing put options onits own stock creates wrong-

way e xposures for the buyer that is specific to the counterparty. A bank must have  

proceduresin place toidentify, monitor and control cases ofspecific wrong way risk , 
beginning at the inception of a tradeand continuing through the life of the trade. To 
calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal 

connectionbetween the counterparty and th e underlying issuer, and for which 

specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same 

netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furth ermore, for single-name 

credit default swaps where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty 
and the underlying issuer, and where specificwrong way risk has been identified,  
EAD in resp ect of such swap counterparty e xp osure equals the full expected lossin 

the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying  

issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of th e  

underlying instrument allows the bank to recognise, in respect ofsuch swap, the 
market value that has been lostalready and any expected recoveries. Accordingl y 
LGD for Advanced or Foundation IRB banksmust be set to 100% for such swap  

transactions.
41
 For banks using the StandardisedApproach, the risk weight to use is

that of anunsecured transaction.For equity derivatives, bond options , securi ties 
financing transactions  etc. referencing a single company wh ere there exists a legal 
connectionbetween the counterparty and the underlying company,  and where  

specific wrong way risk has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction 

under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this 

makes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations  (for IRC) that already 

contain an LGD assumpt i on, the LGD must be set to 100%. 
2. Asset value correlation multiplier for large financial institutions  
102. In order to implement the AVC multiplier, para
graph 272 
of the Basel framework  
would be revised as follows: 
272. Throughout this section, PD and L G D are meas ured as decimals, and EAD 
is measured as currenc y (eg euros), except where explicitly noted otherwise. For 
exposures not in default, the formula for calculating risk-weighted assetsis:
42
 
Correlation (R) = 0.12 × (1 Œ EXP(-50 × PD)) / (1 Œ EXP(-50)) +  
0.24 × [1 Œ (1  Œ EXP(-50  × PD)) / (1 Œ EXP(-50))]  
Maturity adj ustment (b) = (0.11852 Œ 0.05478 × ln(PD))^2 
Capital requirement
43
 (K) = [LGD × N[(1  Œ R)^-0.5 × G(PD) + ( R / (1 Œ 
R))^0.5 × G(0.999)] Œ PD x LGD] x (1 Œ 1.5 x b)^-1 × (1 + 
(M Œ 2.5) × b) 
Risk-weighted assets (RWA) = K x 12.5 x EAD 
The capitalrequirement (K) for a defaulted exposure is equal to the greater of zero 
and the difference between its LGD (described in paragraph 468) and the bank™s 
best estimate of expected loss (described in paragraph 471). The risk-weighted 
asset amount for the defaulted exposure is the product of K,12.5, and the EAD. 
A multiplier of 1.25 is applied to the correlation parameter of all exposures t o  
financialinstitutions meeting the following criteria: 
- Regulated financial institutions whose total assets  are greater than or eq ual to 
US $100 billion. The most recentaudited financial statement of theparent 
company a nd consolidated subsidiaries must be used in order to determine  

assetsize.For the purpose ofthis paragraph,a regulatedfinancial institution 

is defined as  a parent and its subsidiaries where any substantial legalentity in

limited to, prudentially regulated Insurance Companies, Broker/Dealers, 
Banks, Thrifts and Futures Commission Merchants; 
- Unregulated financial institutions ,regardlessof size. Unregulated financial 
institutions are, for the purposes of this paragraph, legal entities whose main  
business includes: the manage me nt of financial assets, lending, factoring,

3. Collateralised counterparties and margin period of risk 
Increase the margin period of risk 
103. 
In order to implement the increased margin
 periods of
 risk, the following new 
paragraphs41(i) and 41 (ii) will be inserted intoAnnex 4 of the Basel II framework:  
41(i). For transac tions subject to daily re-margi ning andmark-to-market  
valuation, a supervisory floor of five busi
ness days for netting sets consisting only of 
repo-style transactions,and 10 business days for allothernetting sets is imposed 
on the margin period of risk used for the purp ose of mod elling EAD with margin  
agreements. In the following casesa higher supervisory floor is imposed: 
 For all netting sets where the numb er of trades exceeds 5,000 at any p oint 
during a quarter, a supervisory floor 
of 20 business days is imposed for the 
margin period of risk for the followingquarter.  
 For netting setscontai ning one or more trades involving either illiquid 
collateral,or an OT C derivative that cannot be ea sily replaced, a  
supervisory floor of 20businessdays is imposed for the margin period of 

risk. For these purposes, ﬁIlliquid collateralﬂand ﬁOTC derivatives that 

cannot be easily replacedﬂ must be determined in the context of stressed 
market conditions and will be charac terised by the absence of continuously 
active markets wherea counterparty would, within two or fewer days, 

obtain multiple price quotations that would not move t he market or 

represent aprice reflec ting a market discount (in the caseof collateral) or 

premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where 
trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not limite d to, 
trades thatare not marked daily and trades that are subj ect to specific 

accounting treatment for valuation purposes (eg OTC derivatives or re po-

style transac tions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by 

models with inputs that are not observed in the market).  
 In addition,a bank must considerwhether trades or securitiesit holds  as 
collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if  that  
counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the bank would be 
able to replac e its trades.  
41 (ii).
 
If a bank has experienced more  than two  margin call disputes on a 
particular netting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the 

applicablemargin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the  

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems 
41
 
 
bank must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of ri sk thatis at 
least double the supervisory floor for that n etting set for the subsequent two 
quarters. 
41(iii). For re-margining with a periodicity of N-days, i rrespective of the shortcut 
method or f ull IMM mo del, the margin period of risk should be at least equal to th e  

supervisory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,  
Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1. 
Paragraph 167 of Basel II (Adjustment for diff erent holding periods and non daily mark-to-

market or remargining) will be replac ed with the following: 
167. The minimu m holding period for various products is summarised in the 

following tabl e. 
Transactiont ype 
Minimum holding period Condition 
Repo -style transaction  
five business days daily remargin ing 
Other capital market transactions  ten business days 
daily remargining 
Secured lending 
twenty business days daily revaluation 
 
Where a bank has such a transaction or netting set which meets the criteria outlined 

in paragraphs 41(i) or 41 (ii) of Annex 4, the mi nimum holdi ng period should be the 
margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs.  
   
Paragraph 179 of Basel II (Use of models) will bereplaced with the following: 
179. The quantitative and qualitative criteria for recognition of internal market risk 
models for repo-style transactions and other similar transactions are in principle the 

same as in paragraphs 718 (LXXI V) to 718 (LXXVI). With regard to the holding 
period, the minimu m wil l  be 5-business days for repo-style t ransactions, rather tha n  
the 10-business daysin paragraph 718 (LXXVI) (c). For other transacti ons eligible 

for the VaR models approach, the 10-business day holding period will be retained. 

The minimu m holding period should be adjusted upwards for market instruments 

where such a holdingperiod would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the 

instrument concerned.At a minimum, where a bank has a repo-style or similar 
transactionor netting set which meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs 41(i) or 41 
(ii) of Annex 4, the minimum holding periodshould be themargin period of risk that 

would apply under thoseparagraphs, in combination with paragraph 41(iii). 
Revise the shortcut meth od for estimating Effective EPE

Paragraph 41 of Annex 4 in Basel II will be revised as follows :  
41. 
Shortcut method: a bank that can 
model EPE without mar gin agreements 
but cannot achieve the higher level of modelling sophistication to mod el EPE with  
margin agreements can use the following method for margined counterparties  

42 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
subject to re-margining and daily mark-to-market
 
as described in paragraph 41 (i).
44
 
The method is a simpleapproximati on to Effective EPE and sets Effective EPE for a  
margined counterparty equal to the lesser of: 
a) Effective EPE without any held or posted ma rgining collateral, plus any 
collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily 
valuation and margining process or current exposure (ie initial margin or 
independent amount); or  
b) An add-on t hat reflectsthe potential increase in exposure o ver the margin 
period of risk plus thelarger of  
i. the currentexposure net of and including all collateralcurrently held or 
posted, excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or  
ii. the largestnet exposure includingall collateral held or posted
 
under the 
margin agreement that would not trigger acollateralcall. This amount 
should reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum tra nsfer amounts, 
independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement. 
The add-on is calculated as E[ max(
û
MtM,  0)], where E[–] is  the 
expectation (ie the average over scenarios) and 
û
MtM is the possible 
change of the mark-to-market valu e of the transactions during the margin 
period of risk. Changes in the value of collateralneed to be reflected using 
the supervisory haircut method or the internal estimates method, but  no 
collateral payments are assumed during the margin period of ri sk.The  

margin period of riskis subjec t to the supervisory floor specifiedin  

paragraphs 41(i) to41(iii). Backtestingshould testwhether realised 

(current) exposures are consistentwith the shortcut metho d prediction over 

all margin periods within one year. If some of t he trades in the netting set 
have a mat urity of less than one year, and the netting sethas higher ri sk 
factor sensitivities without these trades, thisfact should be takeninto  

account. Ifbacktesti ngindicates that effective EPE is underestimated, the 

bank should take actions to make the method more conservative, eg by 

scaling up risk factor moves. 
Preclude downgrade triggers from b eing reflected in EAD 
105. 
In order to explicitly disa
llow downgr
ade triggers in EAD, a n
e w paragraph 41(iv) will 
be inserted into Annex 4 to read as follows:
 
41(iv). Banks using the internal models method mu st not capture the effect of a  
reduction ofEAD due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of 

collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates. 
Add requirements to improve the operational performance of the collateral department  
106. To implement the requirements desi

paragraph 777(x), Part 3: The Second Pillar Œ Supervisory Review Pro c ess, will be revised 
as follows: 
51(i). Banks applying the internal model method must have a collatera l  
managemen t unit that is responsible for calculating and making margin calls, 

managing margin calldisputes and reportinglevels of independent amounts,initial 

margins and variation margins accurately on a d aily basis. This unit must control the 

integrity of the data used to makemargin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and 
reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data withinthe bank. This unit must  
also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash) and the rights  

that the bank gives away to its respective counterparties  for the collateral thatit 

posts. These internal reports must indicate the categories of collateralassets that 

are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and 
maturity. Th e unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes 
accepted by the banks. Senior management must allocate sufficientresources to  

this unit for its systems to have an a ppropriate level of operational performance, as  

measured by the timeli ness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to  

incoming calls. Senior managemen t must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed 

to processcalls and disputes in atimely mann er even under severe market crisis, 
and to enable the bank to limit its number 
of large disputes caused by trad e 
volumes .  
51(ii). The bank™s collateralmanagemen t unit must produce and maintain  
appropriatecollateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to 

senior management. Su ch internal reporting should include information on the t ype  
of collateral (both cash and non-cash) received and posted, as well as the size,  
aging and cause for margin call disputes. Thi
s internal reporting should also refl ect 
trends in thes e figures. 
777(x).  The bank must conduct an independent review of the CCR manage ment 
system regularly through its own internal auditing process. This review must include 
both the activities of the business credit and trading units and of the independent 
CCR control  unit. A revie w of the ove rall CCR ma nagement p rocess must take place 

at regular intervals (ideally not less thanonce a year) and must specifically address, 

at a minimu m: 
 the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR manageme nt system a nd 
process; 
 the organisation of the collateral management unit; 
 the organisation of the CCR control unit; 
 the integration of CCR measures into daily riskmanagemen t; 
 the approval process for risk pricingmodels and valuation systems used by 
front and back-office personnel; 
 the validation of any significantch
ange in the CCR measur ement process; 
 the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement 
model; 
 the integrity of the management information system; 
 the accuracy and completeness ofCCR data; 
 the accurate reflectionof legal terms in collateral and netting agreements 
into exposure measurements; 

44 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor

 the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources 
used to run internalmodels, including theindependence of suchdata 
sources; 
 the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions; 
 the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations ; and 
 the verification of the model™s accuracy through frequent backtesting. 
Require men ts on the controls around the reuseof collateralby IMM ban ks 
107. 
To impleme nt the requirements on controls regarding the reuse of collateral, a new 
paragraph 51(iii) will be 
included in Annex 4 as follows: 
51(iii). A bank employing the internal models method must ensure that its cash 
managemen t policies account simultaneously for the liquidity risks of potential  

incoming margin calls in the context of exchanges of variation margin or other 

margin type s, such asinitial or independent margin, under adverse ma rket shocks, 

potential incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted by counterparties, 
and calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public rating. The bank 
must ensure that the nature and horizon of collateral reuse is consistent with its 

liquidity needs and does not jeopardise its abili
ty to post or return collateral in a  
timely mann er. 
Require banks to usesupervisory haircuts whentransforming  non-cash OTC collateral into 

cash-equi
valent. 
108. To implement the supervisory h aircuts for non-cash OTC collateral, a new 

paragraph 61(i) would be incorporated in Annex 4 as follows: 
61(i). For a bank to recognise inits EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the 

effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, ifit is 

not able to model collateral jointly with the exp osure then it must use e i ther haircuts 
that meet the standards of the financial collateral comprehensive method with own 
haircut estimates or the standard supervisory ha ircuts. 
Require men t for banks to model non-cash collateral jointly with underlying securities for OTC 

Derivatives and 
SFTs. 
109. To ensure the robustness of non-cash collateral, a new paragraph 61(ii) will be
 
inserted in A
nnex 4 as follows: 
61(ii).
 
If the internal model includes theeffect of collateral on changes in the 
market valu e of the net ting set, the bank must model collateral other than cash of  

the same c urrency as the exposure itself jointly with the  exposure i n its EAD 

calculationsfor securities -financing transactions. 
Revise credit risk mi tigation section to add a qualitative collateral manage ment require ment 
110. To ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the orderly operation of margin
 
agreements for OTC derivative and SFT cou
nterparties, and thatappropriate collatera l 
managemen t policies are in place, a new paragraph 115(i) will be inserted into themain text 
and will read as follows:
 
115(i). Banks must ensure that sufficientresources are devoted to the orde rl y 

operation of margin agreements with OTC derivative a nd securities -financing

counterparties, as measured by the t i meline
ss and accuracy of its outgoing calls and 
response time to incoming calls. Banks 
must have collateral manageme nt policies in 
place to control, monitor and report:  
 the risk towhich margin agreements exposesthem (such as the volatility 
and liquidityof the securities exchanged as collateral),  
 the concentration risktoparticular types of collateral, 
 the reuse of collateral(both cash and non-cash) including the potential 
liquidity shortfalls resulting from the reuse of collateral received fro m  
counterparties, and 
 the surrender of rights on collateralposted to counterparties. 
Revise text to establish standard supervisory haircuts for securitisationcollateral 
111. 
To implement the supervisory haircuts fo
r securitisation co
llateral, a new paragrap
h 
145(i) will be inserted into the Baseltext and paragraph 151 will be revised as follows : 
145(i). Re-securitisations (as defined in the securitisati on framewo rk), irrespective  
of any credit ratings, are not eligible financial collateral.This prohibition applies 
whether the bank is using the supervisory haircuts method, the own estimates of  

haircuts method, the repo VaR meth od or the internal model method.  
151. These are the standardised supervisory haircuts (assuming daily mark-to-

Treat ment of highly leveraged counterparties 
112. The Commit tee believes it is appropriate to add a qualitative requiremen t indicating 
that the PDestimates for highly leveraged counterparties should reflectthe performance of 
their assetsbased on a stressed period and, thus, is introducing a new paragraph after 415  

of the framework to read as follows: 

46 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
415(i). PD e s timates for borrowers that are highly leveraged or for borrowers whose  
assets are predominantly traded assets  must reflec tthe performance of the 
underlying assets based on periodsof stressedvolatilities. 
4. Centralcounterparties  
113. 
The Committee acknowledges the ongoing work of the Committee on Payment and
 
Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the Internati
onal Organization of Securities Commissions
 
(IOSCO) to  review the 2004 
CPSS-IOSCO Recommenda tions for Central Counterparties
. 
Subject to the completion of the revision of
 theCPSS-I OSCO standards, which cover, among  
other things, the risk management of a CCP, the Committee will apply a regulatory capital 
treatment for exposures to CCPs based in part on thecompliance of the CCP with the  

enhancedCPSS-I OSCO standards. The Committee se parately will issue for public 

consultati on a set ofrules relati ng to thecapitalisation of bank exposures to central  
counterparties (CCPs). This set of standards will be finalised during 2011, once such  
consultati on and an impact study are complete and after CPSS-IOSCO has completed the 

update of its standards applicable to CCPs. Th e Committee intends for these standards to 

come into effect at the same time as other counterparty credit risk reforms.  
5.  Enhanced counterparty credit risk management requirements
 
114. 
Paragraph 36 of Annex 4 will be revised as follows to increase the robustness o
f
 
banks™ ownestimates of alpha. 
36. To this end, banks must ensure that the numerator and denominator of  
alpha are computed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling 

methodology, paramet er specifications and portfolio composition. The approach 

used mustbe based on the bank™s internal ec onomic capital approach, be well-
documented and be subject to independent validation. In addition, banks must 
review their estimateson at leasta quarterly basis, andmore frequently when the  

composition of the portf olio varies over ti me. Ba nks must assess the model risk and  

supervisors should bealert tothe significantvariation inestimates of alphathat 

arises from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator, 
especially where convexity is present. 
Stress testing 
115. 
The qualitative requirements set forth in Annex 4 for stress 
testing that
banks must 
perform whe n using the internal mod el method h ave been e x panded and made more explicit. 
More specific ally, the existing paragraph 56, Annex 4, of the Basel II text will be replaced 

with the following: 
56. Banks must have a comprehensive stresstesting program for counterparty 

credit risk. The stress testing program must include the following elements: 
 Banks must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation 
across all forms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at t he 
counterparty-specific level in asufficient ti me frame to conduct regular 

stress testing. 
 For all counterparties, banks should produce, at least monthly, exposure 
stresstesting of principal market risk factors (eg interest rates, FX, equities, 

credit spreads, and commodit y pri c es) in order to proactively identify, and 
when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to spec ific directional 
sensitivities.   

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems 
47
 
 
 Banks should apply multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material 
non-directional risks (ie yield curve ex
posure, basis risks, etc) atleast 
quarterly. Multiple-factor stress tests should, ata minimum, aim to address 
scenariosin which a) severe economic or mark et events have occurred; b) 
broad market liquidi ty has decreased signifi cantly; and c) the market impact 

of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. Th ese stress tests 

may be part of bank-wide stress testing.   
 Stressed market move ments have  an impact not only o n  counterparty 
exposures, but also on the credit quality of counterparties. At least 

quarterly, banksshould conduct stress testingapplying stressedconditions 

to the jointmove ment o f exposures and counterparty creditworthiness. 
 Exposure stress testing (includingsingle factor, multifactor and mate rial 
non-directional risks) and joint stressing of exposure andcreditworthiness 
should be performed at  the counterparty-specific, counterparty group (eg 
industry and region), and aggregate bank-wideCCR levels.  
 Stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior 
managemen t. The analysis should capture 
the largest counterparty-level 
impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the 

portfolio (within the same industry or region), and releva nt portfolio and 

counterparty specific trends. 
 The severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the 
stress test.When evaluating solvency under stress, factorshocks should 
be severe enough tocapture historical extreme market  environme nts 
and/or extreme but plausiblestressed market conditions. The impact of 

such shoc ks on capi tal resources should be evaluated, as well as the 

impact on capital requirements andearni
ngs. For the purpose of day-to-day 
portfolio monitoring, hedging, and managemen t of concentrations, banks 
should alsoconsider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability. 
 Banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extre me, but 
plausible,scenarios thatcould resultin signifi cant adverse outcomes. 
 Senior man agement must take a lead role in the integration of stress 
testing intothe risk management framework a nd risk culture of the bank 
and ensure that the results are meaningful andproactively used to manage  

counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results ofstress testing fo r 

significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the 

bank™s riskappetite and elevated for discussionand actionwhen excessive  
or concentrated risks are present.   
Model validation and backtesting 
116. 
On model validation, the following paragraph (currently in paragraph 42) will be 
moved after 
paragraph 40 of Annex 4: 
40bis.
 An EPE mo del must also include transaction-specific information in order to 
capture the effects of margining. It must take into account both the current 
amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties 
in the future. Such a model mu st account for the nature of margin 

agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the 

margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the bank is 

willing to accept, and the minimu m transfer amount. Such a model mu st 
either model the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or 
apply this Framework™s rules for collateral. 

48 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
117. The currentBasel II requirements for backtesti ng will be replaced with the following: 
42. It is important that supervisory auth orities are able to assure themselve s  
that banks us ing models have counterparty 
credit risk management syste ms that are  
conceptually sound and implement ed with integrity. Accordingly the supervisory 

authority will specify a n umber of qu alitative criteria that banks would have to mee t  

before they are permitt ed to use a  models-based approach. The ext ent to which 

banks meet the qualitative criteria may influence the level at which supervisory 
authoritieswill set themultiplication factor referred to in paragraph 32 (Alpha) above. 
Only those banks in full  compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible for 

applicationof the minimum multiplication factor.The qualitative criteria include: 
 The bank must conducta regular programme of  backtes ting, ie an ex-post 
comparison of the risk measures
45
 generated by th e model aga inst realised 
risk measures, as wellas comparing hypothetical changesbased on static 
positions with realised measures. 
 The bankmust carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic 
review of its IMM mod el and the risk measures generated by it.The 
validation and review must be independent of the model developers.  
 The board of directors and senior management should be ac tively involved 
in the risk control process and must regard credit and counterparty credit 
risk control as an essential aspect of the businesstowhich signifi cant 

resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by 

the independent risk control unit must be reviewed  by a le vel of 

managemen t with sufficient seniority and a uthority to enforce both 
reductionsof positions taken by i ndividual traders and reductions in the 
bank™s overall risk exposure. 
 The bank™s internal risk measurement expos ure model must be closely 
integrated into the day-to-day risk manage me nt processof the bank. Its 

output should accordingl y be an integral part of the process of planning,  

monitoring and controlling the bank™s counterparty credit riskprofile. 
 The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal 
trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits shouldbe 

related to the bank™s risk measurement model in a manner tha t is 

consistentover time and that iswell understood by traders, thecredit 
function and senior management. 
 Banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a 
documented set of internal policies, controlsand procedures  concerni ng  
the operation of the risk meas urement system. The bank™srisk 

measureme nt system must be well 
documented, for example, through a  
risk management man ual thatdescribes the basic principles of the risk 

managemen t system a nd that pro vides an e xplanation of the empi rical 
techniquesused to measure counterparty credit risk.  
 An independent review of the riskmeasureme nt system should be carried 
out regularly in the bank™s own internal auditing process. This review should 
                                                
 
45
 ﬁRisk measuresﬂ refers not only to
 Effective EPE, the risk measur e us ed to 
deriv e regulator y capital, but als o  
to the other risk measures used in t
he calculation of Effective EPE such 
as the exposure

series of futur e dates, the p ositive e xpos ur e distrib utio n
 a t  a series of f uture d ates, the market risk f actors 
used to d erive those e xp osur es and th e valu es 
of the consti tuent tr

49
 
 
include both the activities of the businesstrading units  and of the 
independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management 
processshould take plac e at regular intervals (ideally no less than once a  

year) and should specifically address, at a minimum: 
 The adequacy of the do cumentation of the risk managemen t system 
and process; 
 The organisation of the ri sk control unit; 
 The integration of counterparty credit risk measures intodaily risk 
managemen t; 
 The approval process for counterparty credit risk models us ed inthe 
calculationof counterparty credit risk used byfront officeand back 
office personnel; 
 The validation of any significant change in the risk measurement 
process; 
 The scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk 
measureme n t model; 
 The integrity of the management information system; 
 The accuracy and completeness of position data; 
 The verification of theconsistency, timelinessand reliability of data  
sources used to run internal models, including the independence of 
such data sources; 
 The accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation 
assumptions; 
 The accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations ; and  
 The verification of the model™s accuracy as described below in 
paragraphs 43-46. 
 The on-going validation of counterparty cre dit risk models, including 
backtesti ng, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management wit h  
sufficient authority to decide thecourse of ac tion thatwill be taken to 

address weaknesses inthe models. 
43. Banks must document the process for initial and on-going validation of their 

IMM model  to a level  of detail that would enable a third party to  recreate the 
analysis. Banks must also document the calculation of the risk measures  generated 
by the mod els to a level of detail that would allow a third p arty to re-create the risk 

measures. This documentation must set out the frequency with which backtes ting 

analysis and any other on-going validation willbe conducted, how the validation is 

conductedwith respect to dataflows and portfolios and theanalyses that are used. 
44. Banks must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the 
models that input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that 

describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and  

remedied.  

50 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
45. Banks must definehow representative counterparty portfolios are 
constructedfor the purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures. 
46. When validating EPE models and its risk measures thatproduce forecast  
distributions, validation must assess more than a single statistic of the model 

distribution. 
46(i) As part of the initial and on-goingvalidation of an IMM model and its risk  
measures, the followingrequirements must be met: 
 A bank must carry out backtesti ngusing historical data onmove ments in 
market risk factors prior to supervisory appro val. Backtestingmust consider 
a number of distinct prediction timehorizons out to at least one year, ove r a 
range of various start (i nitialisation) dates andcovering a wide range of 

market conditions.  
 Banks must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model™s 
relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictionsthat 

support EPE. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons 

consideredmust include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk  

applied incollateralised/margined trading, and must include longtime 
horizons ofat least 1 year. 
 The pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure f or a 
given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as 
part of theinitial and on-going model validation process.These pricing 

models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a 

short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the nonlinearity 

of option value with respect to market risk factors. 
 An EPE model must capture transacti on specific information in order to 
aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. Banksmust verify that 
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model. 
 Static, historical backtesti ng on representative counterparty p ortfolios must 
be a part of the validation process. At regularintervals asdirected byits 
supervisor, a bank must conduct such backtesting on a number of 
representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must 

be chosen based on their sensitivity to the  material ri sk factorsand  

correlationsto which the bank is exposed. In addition, IMM banks need to 

conduct backtesting that is designed to testthe key assumptions of the 
EPE model and the relevant risk measures, eg the modelled relationship 
between tenors ofthe same riskfactor, andthe modelled relationships 
between risk factors.  
 Significantdifferences between realised exposures and the forecast 
distributioncouldindicate a problem with themodel or the underlying data 
that the supervisor would require the bank to correct. Under such 
circumstances, supervisors may req uire additional capitalto be held while 
the problem is beingsolved.  
 The performance of EPE models a nd its risk measures must be subject to 
good backtes ting practi ce. The backtesting programme must be capable of 

identifying poor performance in an EPE model™s risk measures.  

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems 
51
 
 
 Banks must validate their EPE mode ls and all relevant risk measures outto 
time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposur e  
is calculated using an internal modelling method. 
 The pricing models used to calcul ate counterparty e xposure must b e  
regularly tested againstappropriate independent benchmarks as part of the 

on-going model validation process.  
 The on-going validation of a bank™s EPE model and the relevant risk 
measures include an assessment of recent performance. 
 The frequency with whi c h the parameters of a n EPE mod el are updated 
needs to beassessed as part of the validation proc ess. 
 Under the I MM,  a mea s ure that is more conservative than  the metric used 
to calculateregulatory EAD for every counterparty, ma y be u s ed in place of 
alpha times Effective EPE with the  prior approval of the supervisor. The 

degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial supervisory 

approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models.The 

bank must validate the conservatism regularly.  
 The on-going assessment of model performance needs to cover all 
counterparties for which the models are used.  
 The validation of IMM models must assess whether or not the bank level  
and nettingset exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.  
49(i). The bank must have an independent risk controlunit that is responsible for 

the designand implementation ofthe bank
™s counterparty credit riskmanagemen t  
system. The unit should produceand analyse daily reports on theoutput of the  

bank™s risk measureme nt model, including an evaluation of the relationship between  

measures of counterparty credit exposure and trading limits. The unit must b e  

independent from the b usiness trading units and should report directly to senior 

managemen t of the bank.
 
B. Addressing reliance on external credit ratings and minimising cliff effects 
1. Standardised inferred rating treatment for long-term exposures  
118. Para. 99 of the Basel II text would be modified as follows:  
99. Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an
 issue-spe
cific 
assessment, the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. Where 
the bank™sclaim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue, the following 
general principles apply. 
 In circumstances where the borrower has aspecific as sessment for an 
issued debt Œ but the bank™s claim is not an investment in this particular 
debt Œ a high quality credit assessment (one which maps into a risk weight 

lower than that which applies to anunrated claim) on that specificdebtmay 

only be ap plied to the bank™s unassessed clai m if this claim ranks 
pari 
passu 
or senior to the claim with an  assessment in all respects. If not, the 
credit assessment cannot be used and the unassessedclaim will receive 

the risk weight for unrated claims. 

52 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
 In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer assessment, this 
assessment typically applies to senior unsecured claimson that issuer. 
Consequently, only senior claims on that issuer will benefit from a hi gh 
quality issuer assessment. Other unassessedclaims of ahighly assessed 
issuer will be treated as unrated. Ifeit
her the issuer or a single issue has a 
low qualityassessment (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than  

that which applies to unrated claims), an una ssessed clai m on the s ame  

counterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior 

unsecured issuer assessment or t
he exposure assessmentwill be assigned 
the same risk weight as is applicableto the low quality assessment. 
2. Incentive to avoid getting exposures rated 
119. 
Para. 733 of the Basel IItext will read as follows:  
733.
 
Credit risk: 
Banks should have met
hodologies that enable them to assess 
the credit risk involved in exposures to indi
vidualborrowers or counterparties as well 
as at the portfolio level.Banks should assess exposures, regardless of whether they 
are rated o r unrated, and determi ne whether the risk weights applied to such 

exposures, under the StandardisedApproach, are appropriate for their inherent risk. 

In those instances where a bank determines that the inherent riskof such an  

exposure, particularly if it is unrated, is 
significantly higher t han that implied by the  
risk weight to which it is assigned, the bankshould consider the higher degree of 
credit risk in the evaluat ion of its overall capitaladequacy. For more s ophisticated 
banks, thecredit review assessment of capital adequacy, at a minimum,  should  

cover four areas: risk rating systems,  portfolio analysis/aggregation, 

securitisation/complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk 

concentrations.  
3. Incorporation of IOSCO™s Code o f Conduct Fundamentals for Credi t Rating 
Agencies 
120. Paragraph 9 1 and 565(b ) of the Basel II text will read as follows (paragraph 90 does 

not need additional changes):  
1.  The recogniti on process 
90. 
 National supervisors are responsible for determining on
 a continuous b
asis 
whether an external credit assessment instit
ution (ECAI) meets the criteria listed in 
the paragraph below. National supervisors should refer to the IOSCO Code  of 
Conduct Fundamentals for Cred it Rating Agencies when determining ECAI  

eligibility. The assessments of ECAIs may be recognised on a limited basis, e.g. by 

type of claims or by jurisdicti on. The supervisory process for recognising ECAIs 
should be made public to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry. 
2.  Eligibility criteria 
91.  An ECAI mu st satisfy each of the following six criteria.  
 Objectivity: no change suggested  
 
Independence: no chan
ge suggested 
 International access/Transparency: The individual assessments,
 the key 
elements underlining the assessments and whether the issuer participated 
in the assessment process 
shouldbe publiclyavailable on a non-selective

53
 
 
basis, unless they are private asse
ssments. In addition, the general 
procedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at assessments 
used by the ECAI should be publiclyavailable. 
 Disclosure:An ECAI sh ould disclose the following information: its code of 
conduct; the general nature of its compensation arrangements with 

assessed entities; its assessment methodologies , including the definition of 

default, the ti me horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default 

rates experienced in each assessment category; and the transitions ofthe 

assessments, e.g. the likelihood ofAA ratings becoming A over time. 
 Resources:no change suggested 
 Credibility: no change suggested 
3.  Operational requirements for use ofexternal credit assessments 
565. 
 The following operational criteria concerning 
the use of 
external credit  
assessments apply in the standardi sed and IRB approaches of thesecuritisati on 
framework: 
(a) 
no change 
 
(b) The extern al credit assessments must be from an eligible ECAI as 
recognisedby the bank™s nationalsupervisor in accordance with paragraphs 90 to  
108 with th e following exception. In contrast with bullet three of paragraph 91, an 

eligible credi t assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions, and the ke y 

elements underlining the assessments must 
be publicly available, on a non-selective 
basis and free of charge.
46
 In other words, arating must be published in an 
accessible form and included in the ECAI™s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash-

flow analysis as well as  sens itivity of ratings to changes in the underlying ratings 

assumptions should be publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are mad e  

available only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy thisrequirement. 
(c) to (f) 
no change 
 
4. ﬁCliff effectsﬂ arising from guarantees and credit derivatives - Credit risk

sovereign entities, PSEs, banks, and securiti es  firms with a lower risk 
weight than the counterparty.  
 other entities that areexternally rated except when credit protecti on is 
provided to a securitisati on exposure.

This would include credit protection provided by parent, subsidiaryand

Recognitionunder the Foundation IRB approach 
302. 
For banks using the foundation approach f
or LGD, th
e approach to  
guarantees and credit derivatives clos el
y follows the treatment under the  
standardised approach as specified in paragraphs 189 to 2 01. The ran ge of eligible 
guarantors is the same as under the standardised approach except tha t companies 
that are internally rated may also be recognisedunder the foundation approach. To 

receive recognition, the requirements outlined in paragraphs 189 to194 must be  

met.  
5. Unsolicited ratings and recognition of ECAI s 
121. 
Paragraph 94 and 108 of the Basel II text will be modified as follows:  
94. 
Banks must use the ch
osen ECAIs and their ratings cons istently for each 
type of claim, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. Banks will not 
be allowed to ﬁcherry-pickﬂ the assessm
ents provided by different ECAIs and to 
arbitrarily change the use of ECAIs. 
108. As a general rule, banks should us e solicitedratings from eligible ECAIs. 
National supervisory authorities may, howeve r, allow banks touse unsolicited 
ratings in the same way as solicited ratingsif they aresatisfied that the credit 

assessments of unsolicited ratings are not inferior in quality to the general quality of 

solicited ratings. However, there may be the potential forECAIs to use unsolicited 

ratings to put pressureon entitiesto obtain solicited ratings. Such behaviour, whe n  
identified,should cause supervisors to consider whether to continue recognising  
such ECAIs as eligible for capital adequacy purposes. 
III. Capitalconservationbuffer 
122. This section outlines the operation of the capital conservation buffer, which is 

designed toensure thatbanks buildup capital buffers outside periods ofstress which can be 

drawn down  as losses are incurred.The requirement is based on simple capitalconservation 

rules designed to avoid breaches ofminimu m capital requirements. 
A. Capital conservation best practice 
123. Outside of periods of stress,
 ban
ks shouldhold buffers  ofcapital above the 
regulatory minimum.  
124. When buffers have been  drawn do wn, one wa y banks should look to reb uild them is 
through reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This couldinclude reducingdividend 

payments, share-backs and staff bonus payments. Banks ma y also choose to raise new 
capital from the private sector asan alternative to conserving internally generated capital. 

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems 
55
 
 
The balance between these options  should be discussedwith supervisors as part of the 
capital planning process. 
125. It isclear that greater efforts shouldbe made torebuild buffers the morethey have  
been depleted. Therefore, in the absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of 

earnings retained by banks for thepurpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase 

the nearer their actualcapital levelsare to the minimum capital requirement.  
126. It is not ac ceptable forbanks which have depleted their capital buffers to use future 
predictionsof recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders, 
other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must 

bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming. 
127. It is also not acceptable for bankswhich have depleted their capital buffers to try 
and use the distributionof capital as a way to signal their financialstrength. Not only is this 
irresponsible from the perspective of an indi vidual bank, putti ng shareholders interests above  
depositors, it ma y also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence, banks in 

aggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in timewhen they should be  

conserving earnings. 
128. The framework reduces the discretion of banks which have depleted their capital 
buffers to further reduce them throu gh generous distributions of earnings. In doing so, the 
framework will strengthen their ability to wi
thstand adverse environments. Implemen tation of 
the framework through internationally agreed c
apital conservation rules will help increase 
sector resilience both going into a downturn,  and provid e the mech anism for rebuilding 
capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining agreater proportion of 

earnings during a down turn will help ensure that capital remains avail able to support the 
ongoing business operations of banks through the period of stress. In this way the fra mework  
should helpreduce procyclicality.  
B. The framework  
129. 
A capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1, i
s
 
established above the regulatory minimu m capital requirement.
47
 Capital distribution 
constraintswill beimposed on a bank when capital levels fall within this  range. Banks will  be 
able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the conservation range  

as they experiencelosses. Theconstraintsimposed only relate to distributions, not the 

operation ofthe bank.  
130. The distribution constraints imposed on banks when their capital levels fall into th e  
range increase as thebanks™ capi tal levels approach theminimu m re quirements. By design,  
the constraints imposed on banks with capital levels at the top of the range would be 
minimal. Thi s reflects an expectation that banks™ capital levels will from time to ti me fall into 

this range. The Basel Committee does not wish to impose constraints for entering the range 

that would be so restrictive as to result in the range being viewed a s  establishing a new 

minimu m capital requirement.

56 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor

131. The table below shows the minimu m capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at 
various levels of the Co mmon  Equit y Tier 1  (CE
T1) capital ratios. For example, a ba nk with a  
CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% is required toconserve 80% of its 
earningsin the subsequent financial year (ie payout no more than 20% in terms of dividends, 

share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments). If the bank wants to make payments in 

excess of the constraints imposed b y this regime, it would h ave the opti on of raising capital in 

the private sector equal to the amount above the constraintwhich it wishes to distribute. This 
would be discussed with the bank™s supervisor as part of the capital planning process. The  
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% minimum Common  

Equity Tier 1 requireme nt, but excludes any a dditional Common  Equit y Tier 1 ne eded to 

meet the 6 %  Tier 1 an d 8% Total Capital requirements. For exa mple, a bank with  8% CET 1  

and no Addi tional Tier 1 or Tier 2  capital would meet  all mi nimum capital requirements, but 
would have a zero conservation buffer and therefore by su bject to the 100% constraint on  
capital distributions.

132.  Set out below are a number of other key aspectsof the requirements: 

(a) 
Elements subject to the restricti on on distributions
: Items considered to be  
distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary payments on 
other Tier1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payme nts to staff. 

Payments that do not result in a depletion of Common  Equ i ty Tier 1, which may for 

example include certainscrip dividends
, are not considered distributions. 
(b) 
Definition of earnings
: Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior 
to the deduction of el ements subjec t to the restriction on distributions.Earnings are  

calculatedafter the tax which would have  been reported had none of the 

distributable items been  paid. As such, any tax i mpact of making suchdistributions 

are reverse d out. Where a bank does not have positive earnings and has a 

Common Equity Tier 1 ratio lessthan 7%, it would berestricted from making 

positive netdistributions. 
(c) 
Solo or consolidated application
: The framework should beapplied at the 
consolidated level, ie restrictions  would be imposed on distributions  out of the  

consolidated group. National supervisors would have the option of applying the 

regime at the solo level to conserve resources inspecific parts  of the group. 
(d) 
Additional supervisory disc retio n
: Althoughthe buffer must be capable of being 
drawn down, banks should not choose in normal times to operatein the buffer 
range simply to compet e with other banks andwin market share. To ensure that this 

does not happen, supervisors have the additional discretion to impose time limits on  

banks operating within the buffer range on a  case-by-case basis. In any case, 

Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor

57
 
 
supervisorsshould ensure that the capital plans of banksseek to rebuild buffers 
over an appropriate timeframe.  
C. Transitionalarrangements 
133. The capitalconservation buffer will 
be phased in between 1
 January 2016 and year 
end 2018 becoming fully effective o n 1 January 2019. It will begin at 0.625% of RWAs on  
1January 2016 and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625 percentage 

points, to reach its final level of 2.5% of RWAs on 1 January 2019. Countries that experience 
excessive credit growth should consider accelerating the build up of the capital conservation  
buffer andthe countercyclical buffer. National authorities have the discretion to impose  

shorter transition periods  and should do so where appropriate. 
134. Banks that already mee t the minimu m ratio requ irement during the transition period  
but remain below the 7% Common  Equity Tier 1 target (minimum plus conservation buffer) 
should maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeti ng the conservation 
buffer as soon as reasonably possibl e. 
135. The division of the buffer into quartiles that determine the minimum capital 
conservation ratios will begin on 1 January 2016. These quartiles will expand as th e capital 

conservation buffer is phased in and will take into account any countercyclical buffer in effect 

during this period. 
IV. Countercyc licalbuffer 
A. Introduction 
136. Losses incurred in the banking sector can be extremel y la rge when a downturn is  
preceded by a period of excess credit growth. These losses can des tabilise the banking 

sector and spark a vicious circle, whereby probl
ems in the financial system can contribute to 
a downturn in the real economy t hat then feeds back on to the ba nking sector. These  

interactions highlightthe particular importance of the banking sector building up additional 
capital defences in periods where the risks of sys tem-wide stress are growing markedly.  
137. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that bankingsector capital requirements 
take account of the macro-financialenvironment in which banks operate. It will be deployed 

by national jurisdicti onswhen excess aggregate cr
edit growth is judged to be associated with  
a build-up of system-wid e risk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect 
it against future potential losses.This focus on excess aggregate credit growth means that 
jurisdictionsare likely to only need to deploy the buffer on an infrequent basis. The buffer for 

internationally-active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers deployed across all the 

jurisdic tionsto which it has credit exposures. 
This means that they will likely find themselves 
subject to a small buffer on a more frequent basis, since credit cyclesare not always highly 

correlated ac ross jurisdic tions.  
138.  The countercyclical buffer regime consists of the following elements: 
(a) National authorities willmonitor credit growth and other indicators thatmay signal a 
build up of system-wide  risk and make asse
ssments of whether credit growth is 
excessive and is leading to the build up 
of system-wi de risk. Based on this 
assessment they willput in pl ace a countercyclical buffer requirement when  

58 
Basel III: Aglobal regulatory framewor kfor 
more resilient banks and banking systems
 
circumstances warrant. This requirement 
will be releasedwhen system-wide risk  
crystallises or dissipates .  
(b) Internationally active ba nks will look  at the geographic location of their private  
sector credit exposures and calculate thei r bank specificcountercyclical capi tal 
buffer requirement as a weighted average of the requirements that are being 

applied in jurisdicti ons to which they have credit exposures. 
(c) The countercyclical buffer requirement to
 which a bank is subject will extend the 
size of the capital conservationbuffer. Banks will besubject to restrictions on 

distributions if they do not meet the requirement.  
B. National counterc yclic al buffer requirements 
139. 
 Each Basel Committee member jurisdict
i
onwill identify an authority with the 
responsibility to make decisions  on the sizeof the countercyclical capital buffer. If the 
relevant national authority judges a period of excess creditgrowth to be leading to the build 
up of system-wide risk, they will consider, t ogether with any other mac roprudential tools at 

their disposal, putting in place a countercyclic
al buffer requirement. This will vary between  

zero and 2.5% of risk weighted assets, depending on their judgement as to the extent of the 

build up of system-wide risk.
48
  
140. The document entitled 
Guidance for national authorities operating the 
countercyclical capital buffer
, sets out the principles that national authorities have agreed to 
follow in ma king buffer decisions . This document provides information that should help banks 

to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by nation al authorities in the  

jurisdictionsto which they have credit exposures. 
141. To give banks time to adjust to abuffer level, a jurisdic tion will pre-announce its 
decisionto raise the level of the countercyclical buffer by up to 12 months.
49
 Decisions by a 
jurisdic tion to decreasethe level of the countercyclical buffer will take effect immediately. 
The pre-announced buffer decisions andthe actual buffers in place for all Committe e  

member juri sdictions will be published on the BIS website. 
C. Bank specific counterc yclical buffer 
142. Banks will be subject to a countercyclica
l
 bufferthat varies between zero and 2.5%  
to total risk weighted assets.
50
 The  buffer that will apply to each bank will reflect the 
geographiccomposition of its portfolio of creditexposures. Banks must meet this buffer with

51
or be subject to the restri ctions 
on distributions set out in the next Section.  
143. Internationally active banks will look at
 the geographic location of theirprivate sector 
credit exposures (including non-bank financial  sector exposures) and calculate their 
countercyclical capital buffer requirement as a weighted average of the buffers that are being  

applied in jurisdicti ons to which they have an e xp osure. Credit exposures in this case include 

all private sector creditexposures that attract a credit risk capital charge or the risk weighted 
equivalent trading bookcapital charges for specific risk, IRC and securitisation.  
144. The weighting applied to the buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be the bank™s  
total credit ri skcharge that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction
52
, 
divided by the bank™s total credit risk charge that
 relates to private sector credit exposures 
across all jurisdictions.  
145.  For the VaR for specificrisk, the incremental risk charge and the comprehensive risk 
measureme nt charge, banks should work with their supervisors to develop an approach that 

would translate these charges into individual instrument risk weights that would t hen be 

allocated tothe geographic location of the specific counterparties that make up the charge. 

However,  it may not always be possible to break down the charges in this way due  to the  

charges being calculated on a portf olio by portf olio basis. In such cases, the charge for the  
relevant portfolio should be allocated to the geographic regions of the constituents of the 
portfolio bycalculating the proportion of the portfolio™s totalexposure at default (EAD) that is 

due to the EAD resulting from counterparties in each geographic region.  
D. Extension of the capital conservation buffer  
146. 
 The countercyclical buffer requirement to
 which a bank is subject is implemented
 
through an extension of the capital 
conservation buffer described in section III. 
147.  The table below shows the minimu m capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at 
various levels of the Common Equit y Tier 1 capi tal ratio.
53
 When the countercyclicalcapital 
buffer is zero in all of the regions to whic
h a bank has private sector credit exposures, the  
capital levels and restrictions set out in the tableare the same as those set out in section III.

publically disclosed with at least the same frequ ency as their minimu m c apital requirements. 

The buffer should be based on the latest relevant jurisdictional countercyclical buffers that  

are available at the date that they calculate their minimum capital requirement. In addition, 

when disclosing their buffer req uirement, b anks must also disclose the geographic 
breakdown of their private sectorcredit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer 
requirement.  
F. Transitionalarrangements 
150. The countercyclical
 buf
fer regime will be phased-in in parallel with the capi tal 
conservation buffer between 1 January 2016 and year end 2018 becoming fully effective on  
1 January 2019. This means that the maxi mum countercyclic al buffer requirement will begin 
at 0.625% of RWAs on1 January 2016 and increase each subsequent year by an additional 

0.625 percentage points, to reach its final maximum of 2.5% of RWAs on 1 January 2019. 

Countries that experience excessive credit grow
th during this transitionperiod will consider 
accelerating the build up of the capi tal cons ervation bufferand the countercyclicalbuffer. In 

addition, jurisdictions may choose to implement  larger countercyclical buffer requirements. In 
suchcasesthe reciproc ity provisions of the regime will notapply to theadditional amounts or 
earlier time-frames.

V. Leverageratio 
A. Rationale and objective 
151. One of theunderlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and 
off-balancesheet leverage in the bankingsystem
. In many cases, banks built up excessive 
leverage while still showing strong risk based capital ratios.During the most severe  part of 
the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduceitsleverage ina manne r 

that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbatingthe positive feedback 

loop between losses, declinesin bank capital, and contraction in credit availability. 
152. Therefore, the Committ ee agreed to introduce a simple, transparent, non-risk based 
leverage ratio that is calibrated to act as a cr
edibl e supplementary measu re to the risk based 
capital requirements. The leverage ratio isintended to achieve the following objecti ves: 
 constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilising  
deleveraging processes which candamage the broader financialsystem and the 
economy; a nd 
 reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based ﬁbackstopﬂ 
measure. 
B. Definition and calculation of the leverage ratio 
153. 
 This section presents the definitio
n and calculation of
 the leverage ratio, which  
would serve as the basis for testingduring the parallel run period. The basis ofcalcul ation is 
the average  of the mont hly leverage  ratio over t he quarter based on the definitionsof capital 
(the capital measure) a nd total exp osure (the exposure measure) spec ified in paragraphs 

154 to 164.The Committee will testa minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of3% during the parallel 

run period from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017. Additional transitional arrangements are 

set out in paragraphs 165 to 167.   
1.  Capital measure 
154. 
 The capital measure for the leverage ratio should be based 
on the new definition 
of 
Tier1 capital as set outin paragraphs 52 to 56of this Framework. The Committee also will 
collect data during the transition period to track the impact of using total regulatory capital  

and Commo n Equity Tier 1.  
155. Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and  
should therefore also be deductedfrom the measure ofexposure. That is, the capital and 
exposure should be measured consistently and
 should avoid double counting. This means 
that deductions from Tier 1 capital(as set out
in paragraphs 66 to 89)should alsobe made  
from the exp osure measure. 
156. According to the treatment outlinedin paragraphs 84 to 89, where a financial entity 
is included in the ac counting cons olidation but not in the regulatory consolidation, the 

investments in the capi tal of thes e entities are required tobe deducted to the extent that that 
they exceed certain thresholds. To ensure 
that the capital andexposure aremeasured  
consistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the assets of such entities included in the 
accountingconsolidation should beexcluded from
 the expos ure measure in proportion to the 
capital thatis excludedunder paragraphs 84 to89.

2.  Exposure measure 
(i)  General me asurement p rinciples  
157. The exposure measure for the leverage ratio 
sh
ould generally follow the accounting 
measure of exposure. To be mea s ured consistently with financial accounts, the following 
should apply:  
 on-balancesheet, non-derivative exposures 
are net ofspecific provisions and 
valuation adjustments (eg credit valuation adjustments); 
 physical or fi nancial collateral, guarantees 
or credit risk mitigation purchased is not 
allowed to reduce on-balance sheetexposures; and 
 netting of loans and deposits is not allowed. 
(ii) On-balance sheet items 
158. 
 Banks should include item
s using th
eir accounting balancesheet for the purposes of 
the leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure me asure should include the following treatments 
for Securities  FinancingTransactions (SFT)
54
 and derivatives. 
(a)  Repurchase agreements  and securities finance 
159. SFT are a form of secured funding and therefor
e an important source 
of balance 
sheet leverage that should be included inthe leverageratio. Therefore, banks should 
calculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:  
 the accounting measure of exposure; and 
 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel IIFramework.
55
  
(b)  Derivatives 
160. Derivatives create two types of exposure: an ﬁon-balance sheetﬂ present value 
reflecting
 th
e fair value of the contract (oftenzero atoutset but subs equently positive or 
negative depending onthe performance ofthecontract), and a notional economic exposure 
representing the underlying economic interest ofthe contract. 
161. Banks should calculatederivatives, including where a bank sells protec ti on using a 
credit derivative, for the purposes ofthe leverage ratio by applying:  
 the accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure  
calculated according tothe Current Exposure Method as identified inparagraphs  
186, 187 and 317 of the Basel II Framework. This ensures  that all derivatives are  
converted in a consistent manner to a ﬁloan equivalentﬂ amo unt; and 
 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel IIFramework.

(iii) Off-balance sheet items 
162. This section relates to off-balance sheet (OBS) items  in paragraphs 82-83, 
(including 83(i)), 84(i-iii), 85-86, and 88-89)of the Basel II Framework. These include 
commitments (including liqui dity facilities), 
unconditionally cancellablecommitments, direct 
creditsubsti tutes, acceptances, standby letters ofcredit, tradeletters ofcredit, failed 

transactions and unsettled securiti es . The treatment of the items included in 83(ii)and 84, ie 

repurchaseagreements and securities financing transactions is addres sed above. 
163. The Commi ttee recognises that OBS items are a source of potentially signifi cant 
leverage. Therefore, banks shouldcalculate the above OBS items forthe purposes  of the 
leverage ratio by applying a uniform 100% creditconversion factor (CCF).  
164. For any commit ments that are unconditionally
 cancellableat any time by the bank 
without prior notice, banks should apply a CCF  of 10%. The Committee will conduct further 
review to ensure thatthe 10% CCF is appropriately conservative based onhistorical 

experience.  
C. Transitionalarrangements 
165. 
The transition period for the leverage ratio will commence 1 January 2011. Th e  
Committee will use
 the
 transition period to monitor banks™ leverage data on asemi-annual  
basis in order to assess whether the proposeddesign andcalibration of the minimu m Tier 1  
leverage ratio of 3% is a ppropriate over a  full credit cycle and for different types of  business 

models. This assessment will include cons id
eration ofwhether awider definition of 
exposures and an offsetti ng adjustment in theca
libration would better achieve the objectives 
of the leverage ratio. The Committee also will closely monitor accounting standards and 

practices to address any differences  in national accounting frameworks that are material to 

the definition and calculation of the leverage ratio. 
166. The transition period will comprise of 
a supervisory monitoring period and a parallel 
run period: 
 The supervisory monito ring period commences 1 January 2011. The supervisory 
monitoring process will focus ondeveloping templates to track ina consistent 
manner the underlying components of the agreed definitionand resulting ratio. 
 The parallel run period commences 1 January 2013 and runs until 1 January 2017.  
During thisperiod, the leverage ratio and its components will be tracked, including 
its behaviour relative tothe risk based requirement. Banksare required to calculate 

their leverage ratio using the definitions of capital and total exposure specifiedin  

paragraphs 154 to 1 64 and their risk based capital requirement. Bank level  

disclos ure of the leverage ratio and its components will start 1 January 2015.
57
 The  
Committee will develop a disclos ure template and closelymonitor disclosure of the  

ratio. 
167. Based on the results of the parallel run period, any final adjustments to the definition 

and calibration of the le verage ratio  will be carried out in th e first half of 2017, with a view to 

migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment o n 1 January 2018 bas ed on appropriate review an d  
calibration.

Annex 2 
The 15 % of common equity 
limit on specified items 
1. This Annex is meant to clarify the calculation of the 15% limit on significant 
investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions (banks,insurance 

and other financial entities); mortgage servicing rights, anddeferred tax assets arising fro m  

temporary di fferences (collectively referred to asspecified items).  
2. The recognition of these specified items will be limited to 15% of Common Equity 
Tier 1 (CET 1) capital, after the application of all deductions. To determine the maximu m 
amount of the specified items that can be recognised*, banks and supervisors  should 

multiply the amount of  CET1** (af ter all deductions, including after the deduction of the 

specified items in full) by 17.65%. This number is derived from the proportion of 15% to 85% 

(ie 15%/85% = 17.65%).  
3. As an exa mple, take a bank with •85 of common equ ity (calculated net of all 
deductions,including after the deduction of the specified items in full). 
4. The maxi mu m amount o f specified items that can be recognised by thisbank in its 
calculation of CET1 capital is •85 x 17.65% = •15. Any exce ss above •15 must be deducted 

from CET1. If the bank has specified items (e xcluding amounts deducted after applying th e  

individual 10% limits) that in aggregate sum up to the 15% limit, CET1 after inclusion of the 
specified items, will amount to •85 + •15 = •10 0. The percentage of specified items to total  
CET1 would  equal 15%. 
 
* The ac tualamount thatwill be recogn ised  may be 
lower than this maximum,either be cause the sum 
of the three specified items ar e bel
ow the 15% limitset out in this annex, or  due to the applic ationof 
the 10% limit applied to each item.  
 
** At this point this is a "h ypothetical" amount ofCE
T1 in that it is us ed  on ly for the purposes of 
determining the deduction  of the spec ified items.
