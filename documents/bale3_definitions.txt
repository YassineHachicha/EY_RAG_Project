Introduction
1. This document, together with the document Basel III: International framework for
liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring, presents the Basel Committee’s1
reforms to strengthen global capital and liquidity rules with the goal of promoting a more
resilient banking sector. The objective of the reforms is to improve the banking sector’s ability
to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus
reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. This document
sets out the rules text and timelines to implement the Basel III framework.
2. The Committee’s comprehensive reform package addresses the lessons of the
financial crisis. Through its reform package, the Committee also aims to improve risk
management and governance as well as strengthen banks’ transparency and disclosures.2
Moreover, the reform package includes the Committee’s efforts to strengthen the resolution
of systemically significant cross-border banks.3
3. A strong and resilient banking system is the foundation for sustainable economic
growth, as banks are at the centre of the credit intermediation process between savers and
investors. Moreover, banks provide critical services to consumers, small and medium-sized
enterprises, large corporate firms and governments who rely on them to conduct their daily
business, both at a domestic and international level.
4. One of the main reasons the economic and financial crisis, which began in 2007,
became so severe was that the banking sectors of many countries had built up excessive on-
and off-balance sheet leverage. This was accompanied by a gradual erosion of the level and
quality of the capital base. At the same time, many banks were holding insufficient liquidity
buffers. The banking system therefore was not able to absorb the resulting systemic trading
and credit losses nor could it cope with the reintermediation of large off-balance sheet
exposures that had built up in the shadow banking system. The crisis was further amplified
by a procyclical deleveraging process and by the interconnectedness of systemic institutions
through an array of complex transactions. During the most severe episode of the crisis, the
market lost confidence in the solvency and liquidity of many banking institutions. The
weaknesses in the banking sector were rapidly transmitted to the rest of the financial system
and the real economy, resulting in a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability.
Ultimately the public sector had to step in with unprecedented injections of liquidity, capital
support and guarantees, exposing taxpayers to large losses.
1 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision consists of senior representatives of bank supervisory
authorities and central banks from Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany,
Hong Kong SAR, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United
States. It usually meets at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, where its
permanent Secretariat is located.
2 In July 2009, the Committee introduced a package of measures to strengthen the 1996 rules governing trading
book capital and to enhance the three pillars of the Basel II framework. See Enhancements to the Basel II
framework (July 2009), available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs157.htm.
3 These efforts include the Basel Committee's recommendations to strengthen national resolution powers and
their cross-border implementation. The Basel Committee mandated its Cross-border Bank Resolution Group
to report on the lessons from the crisis, on recent changes and adaptations of national frameworks for cross-
border resolutions, the most effective elements of current national frameworks and those features of current
national frameworks that may hamper optimal responses to crises. See Report and recommendations of the
Cross-border Bank Resolution Group (March 2010), available at www.bis.org/publ/bcbs169.htm.

5. The effect on banks, financial systems and economies at the epicentre of the crisis
was immediate. However, the crisis also spread to a wider circle of countries around the
globe. For these countries the transmission channels were less direct, resulting from a
severe contraction in global liquidity, cross-border credit availability and demand for exports.
Given the scope and speed with which the recent and previous crises have been transmitted
around the globe as well as the unpredictable nature of future crises, it is critical that all
countries raise the resilience of their banking sectors to both internal and external shocks.
6. To address the market failures revealed by the crisis, the Committee is introducing a
number of fundamental reforms to the international regulatory framework. The reforms
strengthen bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of
individual banking institutions to periods of stress. The reforms also have a macroprudential
focus, addressing system-wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as
the procyclical amplification of these risks over time. Clearly these micro and
macroprudential approaches to supervision are interrelated, as greater resilience at the
individual bank level reduces the risk of system-wide shocks.
A. Strengthening the global capital framework
7. The Basel Committee is raising the resilience of the banking sector by
strengthening the regulatory capital framework, building on the three pillars of the Basel II
framework. The reforms raise both the quality and quantity of the regulatory capital base and
enhance the risk coverage of the capital framework. They are underpinned by a leverage
ratio that serves as a backstop to the risk-based capital measures, is intended to constrain
excess leverage in the banking system and provide an extra layer of protection against
model risk and measurement error. Finally, the Committee is introducing a number of
macroprudential elements into the capital framework to help contain systemic risks arising
from procyclicality and from the interconnectedness of financial institutions.
1. Raising the quality, consistency and transparency of the capital base
8. It is critical that banks’ risk exposures are backed by a high quality capital base. The
crisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings, which
is part of banks’ tangible common equity base. It also revealed the inconsistency in the
definition of capital across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled
the market to fully assess and compare the quality of capital between institutions.
9. To this end, the predominant form of Tier 1 capital must be common shares and
retained earnings. This standard is reinforced through a set of principles that also can be
tailored to the context of non-joint stock companies to ensure they hold comparable levels of
high quality Tier 1 capital. Deductions from capital and prudential filters have been
harmonised internationally and generally applied at the level of common equity or its
equivalent in the case of non-joint stock companies. The remainder of the Tier 1 capital base
must be comprised of instruments that are subordinated, have fully discretionary non-
cumulative dividends or coupons and have neither a maturity date nor an incentive to
redeem. Innovative hybrid capital instruments with an incentive to redeem through features
such as step-up clauses, currently limited to 15% of the Tier 1 capital base, will be phased
out. In addition, Tier 2 capital instruments will be harmonised and so-called Tier 3 capital
instruments, which were only available to cover market risks, eliminated. Finally, to improve
market discipline, the transparency of the capital base will be improved, with all elements of
capital required to be disclosed along with a detailed reconciliation to the reported accounts.

10. The Committee is introducing these changes in a manner that minimises the
disruption to capital instruments that are currently outstanding. It also continues to review the
role that contingent capital should play in the regulatory capital framework.
2. Enhancing risk coverage
11. One of the key lessons of the crisis has been the need to strengthen the risk
coverage of the capital framework. Failure to capture major on- and off-balance sheet risks,
as well as derivative related exposures, was a key destabilising factor during the crisis.
12. In response to these shortcomings, the Committee in July 2009 completed a number
of critical reforms to the Basel II framework. These reforms will raise capital requirements for
the trading book and complex securitisation exposures, a major source of losses for many
internationally active banks. The enhanced treatment introduces a stressed value-at-risk
(VaR) capital requirement based on a continuous 12-month period of significant financial
stress. In addition, the Committee has introduced higher capital requirements for so-called
resecuritisations in both the banking and the trading book. The reforms also raise the
standards of the Pillar 2 supervisory review process and strengthen Pillar 3 disclosures. The
Pillar 1 and Pillar 3 enhancements must be implemented by the end of 2011; the Pillar 2
standards became effective when they were introduced in July 2009. The Committee is also
conducting a fundamental review of the trading book. The work on the fundamental review of
the trading book is targeted for completion by year-end 2011.
13. This document also introduces measures to strengthen the capital requirements for
counterparty credit exposures arising from banks’ derivatives, repo and securities financing
activities. These reforms will raise the capital buffers backing these exposures, reduce
procyclicality and provide additional incentives to move OTC derivative contracts to central
counterparties, thus helping reduce systemic risk across the financial system. They also
provide incentives to strengthen the risk management of counterparty credit exposures.
14. To this end, the Committee is introducing the following reforms:
(a) Going forward, banks must determine their capital requirement for counterparty
credit risk using stressed inputs. This will address concerns about capital charges
becoming too low during periods of compressed market volatility and help address
procyclicality. The approach, which is similar to what has been introduced for market
risk, will also promote more integrated management of market and counterparty
credit risk.
(b) Banks will be subject to a capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses (ie
credit valuation adjustment – CVA – risk) associated with a deterioration in the credit
worthiness of a counterparty. While the Basel II standard covers the risk of a
counterparty default, it does not address such CVA risk, which during the financial
crisis was a greater source of losses than those arising from outright defaults.
(c) The Committee is strengthening standards for collateral management and initial
margining. Banks with large and illiquid derivative exposures to a counterparty will
have to apply longer margining periods as a basis for determining the regulatory
capital requirement. Additional standards have been adopted to strengthen collateral
risk management practices.
(d) To address the systemic risk arising from the interconnectedness of banks and other
financial institutions through the derivatives markets, the Committee is supporting
the efforts of the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 3

--- Page 12 ---

International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) to establish strong
standards for financial market infrastructures, including central counterparties. The
capitalisation of bank exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) will be based in
part on the compliance of the CCP with such standards, and will be finalised after a
consultative process in 2011. A bank’s collateral and mark-to-market exposures to
CCPs meeting these enhanced principles will be subject to a low risk weight,
proposed at 2%; and default fund exposures to CCPs will be subject to risk-sensitive
capital requirements. These criteria, together with strengthened capital requirements
for bilateral OTC derivative exposures, will create strong incentives for banks to
move exposures to such CCPs. Moreover, to address systemic risk within the
financial sector, the Committee also is raising the risk weights on exposures to
financial institutions relative to the non-financial corporate sector, as financial
exposures are more highly correlated than non-financial ones.
(e) The Committee is raising counterparty credit risk management standards in a
number of areas, including for the treatment of so-called wrong-way risk, ie cases
where the exposure increases when the credit quality of the counterparty
deteriorates. It also issued final additional guidance for the sound backtesting of
counterparty credit exposures.
15. Finally, the Committee assessed a number of measures to mitigate the reliance on
external ratings of the Basel II framework. The measures include requirements for banks to
perform their own internal assessments of externally rated securitisation exposures, the
elimination of certain “cliff effects” associated with credit risk mitigation practices, and the
incorporation of key elements of the IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit
Rating Agencies into the Committee’s eligibility criteria for the use of external ratings in the
capital framework. The Committee also is conducting a more fundamental review of the
securitisation framework, including its reliance on external ratings.
3. Supplementing the risk-based capital requirement with a leverage ratio
16. One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build up of excessive on- and
off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. The build up of leverage also has been a
feature of previous financial crises, for example leading up to September 1998. During the
most severe part of the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its
leverage in a manner that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating
the positive feedback loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and the contraction in
credit availability. The Committee therefore is introducing a leverage ratio requirement that is
intended to achieve the following objectives:
 constrain leverage in the banking sector, thus helping to mitigate the risk of the
destabilising deleveraging processes which can damage the financial system and
the economy; and
 introduce additional safeguards against model risk and measurement error by
supplementing the risk-based measure with a simple, transparent, independent
measure of risk.
17. The leverage ratio is calculated in a comparable manner across jurisdictions,
adjusting for any differences in accounting standards. The Committee has designed the
leverage ratio to be a credible supplementary measure to the risk-based requirement with a
view to migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment based on appropriate review and calibration.

4. Reducing procyclicality and promoting countercyclical buffers
18. One of the most destabilising elements of the crisis has been the procyclical
amplification of financial shocks throughout the banking system, financial markets and the
broader economy. The tendency of market participants to behave in a procyclical manner
has been amplified through a variety of channels, including through accounting standards for
both mark-to-market assets and held-to-maturity loans, margining practices, and through the
build up and release of leverage among financial institutions, firms, and consumers. The
Basel Committee is introducing a number of measures to make banks more resilient to such
procyclical dynamics. These measures will help ensure that the banking sector serves as a
shock absorber, instead of a transmitter of risk to the financial system and broader economy.
19. In addition to the leverage ratio discussed in the previous section, the Committee is
introducing a series of measures to address procyclicality and raise the resilience of the
banking sector in good times. These measures have the following key objectives:
 dampen any excess cyclicality of the minimum capital requirement;
 promote more forward looking provisions;
 conserve capital to build buffers at individual banks and the banking sector that can
be used in stress; and
 achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the banking sector from
periods of excess credit growth.
Cyclicality of the minimum requirement
20. The Basel II framework increased the risk sensitivity and coverage of the regulatory
capital requirement. Indeed, one of the most procyclical dynamics has been the failure of risk
management and capital frameworks to capture key exposures – such as complex trading
activities, resecuritisations and exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles – in advance of the
crisis. However, it is not possible to achieve greater risk sensitivity across institutions at a
given point in time without introducing a certain degree of cyclicality in minimum capital
requirements over time. The Committee was aware of this trade-off during the design of the
Basel II framework and introduced a number of safeguards to address excess cyclicality of
the minimum requirement. They include the requirement to use long term data horizons to
estimate probabilities of default, the introduction of so called downturn loss-given-default
(LGD) estimates and the appropriate calibration of the risk functions, which convert loss
estimates into regulatory capital requirements. The Committee also required that banks
conduct stress tests that consider the downward migration of their credit portfolios in a
recession.
21. In addition, the Committee has put in place a comprehensive data collection
initiative to assess the impact of the Basel II framework on its member countries over the
credit cycle. Should the cyclicality of the minimum requirement be greater than supervisors
consider appropriate, the Committee will consider additional measures to dampen such
cyclicality.
22. The Committee has reviewed a number of additional measures that supervisors
could take to achieve a better balance between risk sensitivity and the stability of capital
requirements, should this be viewed as necessary. In particular, the range of possible
measures includes an approach by the Committee of European Banking Supervisors (CEBS)
to use the Pillar 2 process to adjust for the compression of probability of default (PD)
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 5

estimates in internal ratings-based (IRB) capital requirements during benign credit conditions
by using the PD estimates for a bank’s portfolios in downturn conditions.4 Addressing the
same issue, the UK Financial Services Authority (FSA) has proposed an approach aimed at
providing non-cyclical PDs in IRB requirements through the application of a scalar that
converts the outputs of a bank’s underlying PD models into through-the-cycle estimates.5
Forward looking provisioning
23. The Committee is promoting stronger provisioning practices through three related
initiatives. First, it is advocating a change in the accounting standards towards an expected
loss (EL) approach. The Committee strongly supports the initiative of the IASB to move to an
EL approach. The goal is to improve the usefulness and relevance of financial reporting for
stakeholders, including prudential regulators. It has issued publicly and made available to the
IASB a set of high level guiding principles that should govern the reforms to the replacement
of IAS 39.6 The Committee supports an EL approach that captures actual losses more
transparently and is also less procyclical than the current “incurred loss” approach.
24. Second, it is updating its supervisory guidance to be consistent with the move to
such an EL approach. Such guidance will assist supervisors in promoting strong provisioning
practices under the desired EL approach.
25. Third, it is addressing incentives to stronger provisioning in the regulatory capital
framework.
Capital conservation
26. The Committee is introducing a framework to promote the conservation of capital
and the build-up of adequate buffers above the minimum that can be drawn down in periods
of stress.
27. At the onset of the financial crisis, a number of banks continued to make large
distributions in the form of dividends, share buy backs and generous compensation
payments even though their individual financial condition and the outlook for the sector were
deteriorating. Much of this activity was driven by a collective action problem, where
reductions in distributions were perceived as sending a signal of weakness. However, these
actions made individual banks and the sector as a whole less resilient. Many banks soon
returned to profitability but did not do enough to rebuild their capital buffers to support new
lending activity. Taken together, this dynamic has increased the procyclicality of the system.
28. To address this market failure, the Committee is introducing a framework that will
give supervisors stronger tools to promote capital conservation in the banking sector.
Implementation of the framework through internationally agreed capital conservation
standards will help increase sector resilience going into a downturn and will provide the
mechanism for rebuilding capital during the economic recovery. Moreover, the framework is

sufficiently flexible to allow for a range of supervisory and bank responses consistent with the
standard.
Excess credit growth
29. As witnessed during the financial crisis, losses incurred in the banking sector during
a downturn preceded by a period of excess credit growth can be extremely large. Such
losses can destabilise the banking sector, which can bring about or exacerbate a downturn in
the real economy. This in turn can further destabilise the banking sector. These inter-
linkages highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up its capital
defences in periods when credit has grown to excessive levels. The building up of these
defences should have the additional benefit of helping to moderate excess credit growth.
30. The Basel Committee is introducing a regime which will adjust the capital buffer
range, established through the capital conservation mechanism outlined in the previous
section, when there are signs that credit has grown to excessive levels. The purpose of the
countercyclical buffer is to achieve the broader macroprudential goal of protecting the
banking sector in periods of excess aggregate credit growth.
31. The measures to address procyclicality are designed to complement each other.
The initiatives on provisioning focus on strengthening the banking system against expected
losses, while the capital measures focus on unexpected losses. Among the capital
measures, there is a distinction between addressing the cyclicality of the minimum and
building additional buffers above that minimum. Indeed, strong capital buffers above the
minimum requirement have proven to be critical, even in the absence of a cyclical minimum.
Finally, the requirement to address excess credit growth is set at zero in normal times and
only increases during periods of excessive credit availability. However, even in the absence
of a credit bubble, supervisors expect the banking sector to build a buffer above the minimum
to protect it against plausibly severe shocks, which could emanate from many sources.
5. Addressing systemic risk and interconnectedness
32. While procyclicality amplified shocks over the time dimension, excessive
interconnectedness among systemically important banks also transmitted shocks across the
financial system and economy. Systemically important banks should have loss absorbing
capacity beyond the minimum standards and the work on this issue is ongoing. The Basel
Committee and the Financial Stability Board are developing a well integrated approach to
systemically important financial institutions which could include combinations of capital
surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in debt. As part of this effort, the Committee is
developing a proposal on a methodology comprising both quantitative and qualitative
indicators to assess the systemic importance of financial institutions at a global level. The
Committee is also conducting a study of the magnitude of additional loss absorbency that
globally systemic financial institutions should have, along with an assessment of the extent of
going concern loss absorbency which could be provided by the various proposed
instruments. The Committee’s analysis has also covered further measures to mitigate the
risks or externalities associated with systemic banks, including liquidity surcharges, tighter
large exposure restrictions and enhanced supervision. It will continue its work on these
issues in the first half of 2011 in accordance with the processes and timelines set out in the
FSB recommendations.
33. Several of the capital requirements introduced by the Committee to mitigate the
risks arising from firm-level exposures among global financial institutions will also help to
address systemic risk and interconnectedness. These include:
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 7

--- Page 16 ---

 capital incentives for banks to use central counterparties for over-the-counter
derivatives;
 higher capital requirements for trading and derivative activities, as well as complex
securitisations and off-balance sheet exposures (eg structured investment vehicles);
 higher capital requirements for inter-financial sector exposures; and
 the introduction of liquidity requirements that penalise excessive reliance on short
term, interbank funding to support longer dated assets.
B. Introducing a global liquidity standard
34. Strong capital requirements are a necessary condition for banking sector stability
but by themselves are not sufficient. A strong liquidity base reinforced through robust
supervisory standards is of equal importance. To date, however, there have been no
internationally harmonised standards in this area. The Basel Committee is therefore
introducing internationally harmonised global liquidity standards. As with the global capital
standards, the liquidity standards will establish minimum requirements and will promote an
international level playing field to help prevent a competitive race to the bottom.
35. During the early “liquidity phase” of the financial crisis, many banks – despite
adequate capital levels – still experienced difficulties because they did not manage their
liquidity in a prudent manner. The crisis again drove home the importance of liquidity to the
proper functioning of financial markets and the banking sector. Prior to the crisis, asset
markets were buoyant and funding was readily available at low cost. The rapid reversal in
market conditions illustrated how quickly liquidity can evaporate and that illiquidity can last for
an extended period of time. The banking system came under severe stress, which
necessitated central bank action to support both the functioning of money markets and, in
some cases, individual institutions.
36. The difficulties experienced by some banks were due to lapses in basic principles of
liquidity risk management. In response, as the foundation of its liquidity framework, the
Committee in 2008 published Principles for Sound Liquidity Risk Management and
Supervision.7 The Sound Principles provide detailed guidance on the risk management and
supervision of funding liquidity risk and should help promote better risk management in this
critical area, but only if there is full implementation by banks and supervisors. As such, the
Committee will coordinate rigorous follow up by supervisors to ensure that banks adhere to
these fundamental principles.
37. To complement these principles, the Committee has further strengthened its liquidity
framework by developing two minimum standards for funding liquidity. An additional
component of the liquidity framework is a set of monitoring metrics to improve cross-border
supervisory consistency.
38. These standards have been developed to achieve two separate but complementary
objectives. The first objective is to promote short-term resilience of a bank’s liquidity risk
profile by ensuring that it has sufficient high quality liquid resources to survive an acute
stress scenario lasting for one month. The Committee developed the Liquidity Coverage
Ratio (LCR) to achieve this objective. The second objective is to promote resilience over a

8 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 17 ---

longer time horizon by creating additional incentives for a bank to fund its activities with more
stable sources of funding on an ongoing structural basis. The Net Stable Funding Ratio
(NSFR) has a time horizon of one year and has been developed to provide a sustainable
maturity structure of assets and liabilities.
39. These two standards are comprised mainly of specific parameters which are
internationally “harmonised” with prescribed values. Certain parameters contain elements of
national discretion to reflect jurisdiction-specific conditions. In these cases, the parameters
should be transparent and clearly outlined in the regulations of each jurisdiction to provide
clarity both within the jurisdiction and internationally.
1. Liquidity Coverage Ratio
40. The LCR is intended to promote resilience to potential liquidity disruptions over a
thirty day horizon. It will help ensure that global banks have sufficient unencumbered, high-
quality liquid assets to offset the net cash outflows it could encounter under an acute short-
term stress scenario. The specified scenario is built upon circumstances experienced in the
global financial crisis that began in 2007 and entails both institution-specific and systemic
shocks. The scenario entails a significant stress, albeit not a worst-case scenario, and
assumes the following:
 a significant downgrade of the institution’s public credit rating;
 a partial loss of deposits;
 a loss of unsecured wholesale funding;
 a significant increase in secured funding haircuts; and
 increases in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and non-
contractual off-balance sheet exposures, including committed credit and liquidity
facilities.
41. High-quality liquid assets held in the stock should be unencumbered, liquid in
markets during a time of stress and, ideally, be central bank eligible.
2. Net Stable Funding Ratio
42. The NSFR requires a minimum amount of stable sources of funding at a bank
relative to the liquidity profiles of the assets, as well as the potential for contingent liquidity
needs arising from off-balance sheet commitments, over a one-year horizon. The NSFR aims
to limit over-reliance on short-term wholesale funding during times of buoyant market liquidity
and encourage better assessment of liquidity risk across all on- and off-balance sheet items.
3. Monitoring tools
43. At present, supervisors use a wide range of quantitative measures to monitor the
liquidity risk profiles of banking organisations as well as across the financial sector, for a
macroprudential approach to supervision. A survey of Basel Committee members conducted
in early 2009 identified that more than 25 different measures and concepts are used globally
by supervisors. To introduce more consistency internationally, the Committee has developed
a set of common metrics that should be considered as the minimum types of information
which supervisors should use. In addition, supervisors may use additional metrics in order to
capture specific risks in their jurisdictions. The monitoring metrics include the following and
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 9

--- Page 18 ---

may evolve further as the Committee conducts further work. One area in particular where
more work on monitoring tools will be conducted relates to intraday liquidity risk.
(a) Contractual maturity mismatch: To gain an understanding of the basic aspects of a
bank’s liquidity needs, banks should frequently conduct a contractual maturity mismatch
assessment. This metric provides an initial, simple baseline of contractual commitments and
is useful in comparing liquidity risk profiles across institutions, and to highlight to both banks
and supervisors when potential liquidity needs could arise.
(b) Concentration of funding: This metric involves analysing concentrations of wholesale
funding provided by specific counterparties, instruments and currencies. A metric covering
concentrations of wholesale funding assists supervisors in assessing the extent to which
funding liquidity risks could occur in the event that one or more of the funding sources are
withdrawn.
(c) Available unencumbered assets: This metric measures the amount of
unencumbered assets a bank has which could potentially be used as collateral for secured
funding either in the market or at standing central bank facilities. This should make banks
(and supervisors) more aware of their potential capacity to raise additional secured funds,
keeping in mind that in a stressed situation this ability may decrease.
(d) LCR by currency: In recognition that foreign exchange risk is a component of
liquidity risk, the LCR should also be assessed in each significant currency, in order to
monitor and manage the overall level and trend of currency exposure at a bank.
(e) Market-related monitoring tools: In order to have a source of instantaneous data on
potential liquidity difficulties, useful data to monitor includes market-wide data on asset prices
and liquidity, institution-related information such as credit default swap (CDS) spreads and
equity prices, and additional institution-specific information related to the ability of the
institution to fund itself in various wholesale funding markets and the price at which it can do
so.
C. Transitional arrangements
44. The Committee is introducing transitional arrangements to implement the new
standards that help ensure that the banking sector can meet the higher capital standards
through reasonable earnings retention and capital raising, while still supporting lending to the
economy. The transitional arrangements are described in the Basel III liquidity rules text
document and summarised in Annex 4 of this document.
45. After an observation period beginning in 2011, the LCR will be introduced on
1 January 2015. The NSFR will move to a minimum standard by 1 January 2018. The
Committee will put in place rigorous reporting processes to monitor the ratios during the
transition period and will continue to review the implications of these standards for financial
markets, credit extension and economic growth, addressing unintended consequences as
necessary.
46. Both the LCR and the NSFR will be subject to an observation period and will include
a review clause to address any unintended consequences.

D. Scope of application
47. The application of the minimum capital requirements in this document follow the
existing scope of application set out in Part I (Scope of Application) of the Basel II
Framework.8
8 See BCBS, International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards, June 2006 (hereinafter
referred to as “Basel II” or “Basel II Framework”).
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 11

--- Page 20 ---

Part 1: Minimum capital requirements and buffers
48. The global banking system entered the crisis with an insufficient level of high quality
capital. The crisis also revealed the inconsistency in the definition of capital across
jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have enabled the market to fully assess
and compare the quality of capital across jurisdictions. A key element of the new definition of
capital is the greater focus on common equity, the highest quality component of a bank’s
capital.
I. Definition of capital
A. Components of capital
Elements of capital
49. Total regulatory capital will consist of the sum of the following elements:
1. Tier 1 Capital (going-concern capital)
a. Common Equity Tier 1
b. Additional Tier 1
2. Tier 2 Capital (gone-concern capital)
For each of the three categories above (1a, 1b and 2) there is a single set of criteria that
instruments are required to meet before inclusion in the relevant category.9
Limits and minima
50. All elements above are net of the associated regulatory adjustments and are subject
to the following restrictions (see also Annex 1):
 Common Equity Tier 1 must be at least 4.5% of risk-weighted assets at all times.
 Tier 1 Capital must be at least 6.0% of risk-weighted assets at all times.
 Total Capital (Tier 1 Capital plus Tier 2 Capital) must be at least 8.0% of risk-
weighted assets at all times.
B. Detailed proposal
51. Throughout this section the term “bank” is used to mean bank, banking group or
other entity (eg holding company) whose capital is being measured.
9 As set out in the Committee’s August 2010 consultative document, Proposal to ensure the loss absorbency of
regulatory capital at the point of non-viability, and as stated in the Committee’s 19 October 2010 and
1 December 2010 press releases, the Committee is finalising additional entry criteria for Additional Tier 1 and
Tier 2 capital. Once finalised, the additional criteria will be added to this regulatory framework.
12 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 21 ---

1. Common Equity Tier 1
52. Common Equity Tier 1 capital consists of the sum of the following elements:
 Common shares issued by the bank that meet the criteria for classification as
common shares for regulatory purposes (or the equivalent for non-joint stock
companies);
 Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included
Common Equity Tier 1;
 Retained earnings;
 Accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves;10
 Common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third
parties (ie minority interest) that meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity
Tier 1 capital. See section 4 for the relevant criteria; and
 Regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1
Retained earnings and other comprehensive income include interim profit or loss. National
authorities may consider appropriate audit, verification or review procedures. Dividends are
removed from Common Equity Tier 1 in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The treatment of minority interest and the regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of
Common Equity Tier 1 are addressed in separate sections.
Common shares issued by the bank
53. For an instrument to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital it must meet all of
the criteria that follow. The vast majority of internationally active banks are structured as joint
stock companies11 and for these banks the criteria must be met solely with common shares.
In the rare cases where banks need to issue non-voting common shares as part of Common
Equity Tier 1, they must be identical to voting common shares of the issuing bank in all
respects except the absence of voting rights.
10 There is no adjustment applied to remove from Common Equity Tier 1 unrealised gains or losses recognised
on the balance sheet. Unrealised losses are subject to the transitional arrangements set out in paragraph 94
(c) and (d). The Committee will continue to review the appropriate treatment of unrealised gains, taking into
account the evolution of the accounting framework.
11 Joint stock companies are defined as companies that have issued common shares, irrespective of whether
these shares are held privately or publically. These will represent the vast majority of internationally active
banks.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 13

Criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory capital purposes12
1. Represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the bank.
2. Entitled to a claim on the residual assets that is proportional with its share of issued
capital, after all senior claims have been repaid in liquidation (ie has an unlimited and
variable claim, not a fixed or capped claim).
3. Principal is perpetual and never repaid outside of liquidation (setting aside
discretionary repurchases or other means of effectively reducing capital in a
discretionary manner that is allowable under relevant law).
4. The bank does nothing to create an expectation at issuance that the instrument will be
bought back, redeemed or cancelled nor do the statutory or contractual terms provide
any feature which might give rise to such an expectation.
5. Distributions are paid out of distributable items (retained earnings included). The level
of distributions is not in any way tied or linked to the amount paid in at issuance and is
not subject to a contractual cap (except to the extent that a bank is unable to pay
distributions that exceed the level of distributable items).
6. There are no circumstances under which the distributions are obligatory. Non payment
is therefore not an event of default.
7. Distributions are paid only after all legal and contractual obligations have been met
and payments on more senior capital instruments have been made. This means that
there are no preferential distributions, including in respect of other elements classified
as the highest quality issued capital.
8. It is the issued capital that takes the first and proportionately greatest share of any
losses as they occur13. Within the highest quality capital, each instrument absorbs
losses on a going concern basis proportionately and pari passu with all the others.
9. The paid in amount is recognised as equity capital (ie not recognised as a liability) for
determining balance sheet insolvency.
10. The paid in amount is classified as equity under the relevant accounting standards.
11. It is directly issued and paid-in and the bank can not directly or indirectly have funded
the purchase of the instrument.
12 The criteria also apply to non joint stock companies, such as mutuals, cooperatives or savings institutions,
taking into account their specific constitution and legal structure. The application of the criteria should preserve
the quality of the instruments by requiring that they are deemed fully equivalent to common shares in terms of
their capital quality as regards loss absorption and do not possess features which could cause the condition of
the bank to be weakened as a going concern during periods of market stress. Supervisors will exchange
information on how they apply the criteria to non joint stock companies in order to ensure consistent
implementation.
13 In cases where capital instruments have a permanent write-down feature, this criterion is still deemed to be
met by common shares.
14 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 23 ---

12. The paid in amount is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or
related entity14 or subject to any other arrangement that legally or economically
enhances the seniority of the claim.
13. It is only issued with the approval of the owners of the issuing bank, either given
directly by the owners or, if permitted by applicable law, given by the Board of
Directors or by other persons duly authorised by the owners.
14. It is clearly and separately disclosed on the bank’s balance sheet.
2. Additional Tier 1 capital
54. Additional Tier 1 capital consists of the sum of the following elements:
 Instruments issued by the bank that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier
1 capital (and are not included in Common Equity Tier 1);
 Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in
Additional Tier 1 capital;
 Instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties
that meet the criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital and are not included in
Common Equity Tier 1. See section 4 for the relevant criteria; and
 Regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Additional Tier 1 Capital
The treatment of instruments issued out of consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and the
regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Additional Tier 1 Capital are addressed in
separate sections.
Instruments issued by the bank that meet the Additional Tier 1 criteria
55. The following box sets out the minimum set of criteria for an instrument issued by
the bank to meet or exceed in order for it to be included in Additional Tier 1 capital.
Criteria for inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital
1. Issued and paid-in
2. Subordinated to depositors, general creditors and subordinated debt of the bank
3. Is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity or other
arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim vis-à-vis
bank creditors
4. Is perpetual, ie there is no maturity date and there are no step-ups or other incentives
to redeem
14 A related entity can include a parent company, a sister company, a subsidiary or any other affiliate. A holding
company is a related entity irrespective of whether it forms part of the consolidated banking group.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 15

--- Page 24 ---

5. May be callable at the initiative of the issuer only after a minimum of five years:
a. To exercise a call option a bank must receive prior supervisory approval; and
b. A bank must not do anything which creates an expectation that the call will be
exercised; and
c. Banks must not exercise a call unless:
i. They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better quality
and the replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are
sustainable for the income capacity of the bank15; or
ii. The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum
capital requirements after the call option is exercised.16
6. Any repayment of principal (eg through repurchase or redemption) must be with prior
supervisory approval and banks should not assume or create market expectations that
supervisory approval will be given
7. Dividend/coupon discretion:
a. the bank must have full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments17
b. cancellation of discretionary payments must not be an event of default
c. banks must have full access to cancelled payments to meet obligations as they
fall due
d. cancellation of distributions/payments must not impose restrictions on the bank
except in relation to distributions to common stockholders.
8. Dividends/coupons must be paid out of distributable items
9. The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive dividend feature, that is a
dividend/coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banking
organisation’s credit standing.
10. The instrument cannot contribute to liabilities exceeding assets if such a balance sheet
test forms part of national insolvency law.
15 Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.
16 Minimum refers to the regulator’s prescribed minimum requirement, which may be higher than the Basel III
Pillar 1 minimum requirement.
17 A consequence of full discretion at all times to cancel distributions/payments is that “dividend pushers” are
prohibited. An instrument with a dividend pusher obliges the issuing bank to make a dividend/coupon payment
on the instrument if it has made a payment on another (typically more junior) capital instrument or share. This
obligation is inconsistent with the requirement for full discretion at all times. Furthermore, the term “cancel
distributions/payments” means extinguish these payments. It does not permit features that require the bank to
make distributions/payments in kind.
16 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 25 ---

11. Instruments classified as liabilities for accounting purposes must have principal loss
absorption through either (i) conversion to common shares at an objective pre-specified
trigger point or (ii) a write-down mechanism which allocates losses to the instrument at
a pre-specified trigger point. The write-down will have the following effects:
a. Reduce the claim of the instrument in liquidation;
b. Reduce the amount re-paid when a call is exercised; and
c. Partially or fully reduce coupon/dividend payments on the instrument.
12. Neither the bank nor a related party over which the bank exercises control or significant
influence can have purchased the instrument, nor can the bank directly or indirectly
have funded the purchase of the instrument
13. The instrument cannot have any features that hinder recapitalisation, such as
provisions that require the issuer to compensate investors if a new instrument is issued
at a lower price during a specified time frame
14. If the instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the holding company in the
consolidated group (eg a special purpose vehicle – “SPV”), proceeds must be
immediately available without limitation to an operating entity18 or the holding company
in the consolidated group in a form which meets or exceeds all of the other criteria for
inclusion in Additional Tier 1 capital
Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Additional
Tier 1 capital;
56. Stock surplus (ie share premium) that is not eligible for inclusion in Common Equity
Tier 1, will only be permitted to be included in Additional Tier 1 capital if the shares giving rise
to the stock surplus are permitted to be included in Additional Tier 1 capital.
3. Tier 2 capital
57. Tier 2 capital consists of the sum of the following elements:
 Instruments issued by the bank that meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital
(and are not included in Tier 1 capital);
 Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in
Tier 2 capital;
 Instruments issued by consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and held by third parties
that meet the criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 capital and are not included in Tier 1
capital. See section 4 for the relevant criteria;
 Certain loan loss provisions as specified in paragraphs 60 and 61; and
 Regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital.
18 An operating entity is an entity set up to conduct business with clients with the intention of earning a profit in
its own right.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 17

--- Page 26 ---

The treatment of instruments issued out of consolidated subsidiaries of the bank and the
regulatory adjustments applied in the calculation of Tier 2 Capital are addressed in separate
sections.
Instruments issued by the bank that meet the Tier 2 criteria
58. The objective of Tier 2 is to provide loss absorption on a gone-concern basis. Based
on this objective, the following box sets out the minimum set of criteria for an instrument to
meet or exceed in order for it to be included in Tier 2 capital.
Criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital
1. Issued and paid-in
2. Subordinated to depositors and general creditors of the bank
3. Is neither secured nor covered by a guarantee of the issuer or related entity or other
arrangement that legally or economically enhances the seniority of the claim vis-à-vis
depositors and general bank creditors
4. Maturity:
a. minimum original maturity of at least five years
b. recognition in regulatory capital in the remaining five years before maturity will
be amortised on a straight line basis
c. there are no step-ups or other incentives to redeem
5. May be callable at the initiative of the issuer only after a minimum of five years:
a. To exercise a call option a bank must receive prior supervisory approval;
b. A bank must not do anything that creates an expectation that the call will be
exercised;19 and
c. Banks must not exercise a call unless:
i. They replace the called instrument with capital of the same or better
quality and the replacement of this capital is done at conditions which are
sustainable for the income capacity of the bank20; or
ii. The bank demonstrates that its capital position is well above the minimum
capital requirements after the call option is exercised.21
6. The investor must have no rights to accelerate the repayment of future scheduled
payments (coupon or principal), except in bankruptcy and liquidation.
19 An option to call the instrument after five years but prior to the start of the amortisation period will not be
viewed as an incentive to redeem as long as the bank does not do anything that creates an expectation that
the call will be exercised at this point.
20 Replacement issues can be concurrent with but not after the instrument is called.
21 Minimum refers to the regulator’s prescribed minimum requirement, which may be higher than the Basel III
Pillar 1 minimum requirement.
18 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 27 ---

7. The instrument cannot have a credit sensitive dividend feature, that is a
dividend/coupon that is reset periodically based in whole or in part on the banking
organisation’s credit standing.
8. Neither the bank nor a related party over which the bank exercises control or
significant influence can have purchased the instrument, nor can the bank directly or
indirectly have funded the purchase of the instrument
9. If the instrument is not issued out of an operating entity or the holding company in the
consolidated group (eg a special purpose vehicle – “SPV”), proceeds must be
immediately available without limitation to an operating entity22 or the holding
company in the consolidated group in a form which meets or exceeds all of the other
criteria for inclusion in Tier 2 Capital
Stock surplus (share premium) resulting from the issue of instruments included in Tier 2
capital;
59. Stock surplus (ie share premium) that is not eligible for inclusion in Tier 1, will only
be permitted to be included in Tier 2 capital if the shares giving rise to the stock surplus are
permitted to be included in Tier 2 capital.
General provisions/general loan-loss reserves (for banks using the Standardised Approach
for credit risk)
60. Provisions or loan-loss reserves held against future, presently unidentified losses
are freely available to meet losses which subsequently materialise and therefore qualify for
inclusion within Tier 2. Provisions ascribed to identified deterioration of particular assets or
known liabilities, whether individual or grouped, should be excluded. Furthermore, general
provisions/general loan-loss reserves eligible for inclusion in Tier 2 will be limited to a
maximum of 1.25 percentage points of credit risk-weighted risk assets calculated under the
standardised approach.
Excess of total eligible provisions under the Internal Ratings-based Approach
61. Where the total expected loss amount is less than total eligible provisions, as
explained in paragraphs 380 to 383 of the June 2006 Comprehensive version of Basel II,
banks may recognise the difference in Tier 2 capital up to a maximum of 0.6% of credit risk-
weighted assets calculated under the IRB approach. At national discretion, a limit lower than
0.6% may be applied.
4. Minority interest (ie non-controlling interest) and other capital issued out of
consolidated subsidiaries that is held by third parties
Common shares issued by consolidated subsidiaries
62. Minority interest arising from the issue of common shares by a fully consolidated
subsidiary of the bank may receive recognition in Common Equity Tier 1 only if: (1) the
instrument giving rise to the minority interest would, if issued by the bank, meet all of the
22 An operating entity is an entity set up to conduct business with clients with the intention of earning a profit in
its own right.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 19

--- Page 28 ---

criteria for classification as common shares for regulatory capital purposes; and (2) the
subsidiary that issued the instrument is itself a bank.23, 24 The amount of minority interest
meeting the criteria above that will be recognised in consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 will
be calculated as follows:
 Total minority interest meeting the two criteria above minus the amount of the
surplus Common Equity Tier 1 of the subsidiary attributable to the minority
shareholders.
 Surplus Common Equity Tier 1 of the subsidiary is calculated as the Common Equity
Tier 1 of the subsidiary minus the lower of: (1) the minimum Common Equity Tier 1
requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital conservation buffer (ie 7.0% of risk
weighted assets) and (2) the portion of the consolidated minimum Common Equity
Tier 1 requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (ie 7.0% of consolidated risk
weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.
 The amount of the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 that is attributable to the minority
shareholders is calculated by multiplying the surplus Common Equity Tier 1 by the
percentage of Common Equity Tier 1 that is held by minority shareholders.
Tier 1 qualifying capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries
63. Tier 1 capital instruments issued by a fully consolidated subsidiary of the bank to
third party investors (including amounts under paragraph 62) may receive recognition in
Tier 1 capital only if the instruments would, if issued by the bank, meet all of the criteria for
classification as Tier 1 capital. The amount of this capital that will be recognised in Tier 1 will
be calculated as follows:
 Total Tier 1 of the subsidiary issued to third parties minus the amount of the surplus
Tier 1 of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.
 Surplus Tier 1 of the subsidiary is calculated as the Tier 1 of the subsidiary minus
the lower of: (1) the minimum Tier 1 requirement of the subsidiary plus the capital
conservation buffer (ie 8.5% of risk weighted assets) and (2) the portion of the
consolidated minimum Tier 1 requirement plus the capital conservation buffer (ie
8.5% of consolidated risk weighted assets) that relates to the subsidiary.
 The amount of the surplus Tier 1 that is attributable to the third party investors is
calculated by multiplying the surplus Tier 1 by the percentage of Tier 1 that is held
by third party investors.
The amount of this Tier 1 capital that will be recognised in Additional Tier 1 will exclude
amounts recognised in Common Equity Tier 1 under paragraph 62.
23 For the purposes of this paragraph, any institution that is subject to the same minimum prudential standards
and level of supervision as a bank may be considered to be a bank.
24 Minority interest in a subsidiary that is a bank is strictly excluded from the parent bank’s common equity if the
parent bank or affiliate has entered into any arrangements to fund directly or indirectly minority investment in
the subsidiary whether through an SPV or through another vehicle or arrangement. The treatment outlined
above, thus, is strictly available where all minority investments in the bank subsidiary solely represent genuine
third party common equity contributions to the subsidiary.
20 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 29 ---

Tier 1 and Tier 2 qualifying capital issued by consolidated subsidiaries
64. Total capital instruments (ie Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital instruments) issued by a fully
consolidated subsidiary of the bank to third party investors (including amounts under
paragraph 62 and 63) may receive recognition in Total Capital only if the instruments would,
if issued by the bank, meet all of the criteria for classification as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital. The
amount of this capital that will be recognised in consolidated Total Capital will be calculated
as follows:
 Total capital instruments of the subsidiary issued to third parties minus the amount
of the surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary attributable to the third party investors.
 Surplus Total Capital of the subsidiary is calculated as the Total Capital of the
subsidiary minus the lower of: (1) the minimum Total Capital requirement of the
subsidiary plus the capital conservation buffer (ie 10.5% of risk weighted assets)
and (2) the portion of the consolidated minimum Total Capital requirement plus the
capital conservation buffer (ie 10.5% of consolidated risk weighted assets) that
relates to the subsidiary.
 The amount of the surplus Total Capital that is attributable to the third party
investors is calculated by multiplying the surplus Total Capital by the percentage of
Total Capital that is held by third party investors.
The amount of this Total Capital that will be recognised in Tier 2 will exclude amounts
recognised in Common Equity Tier 1 under paragraph 62 and amounts recognised in
Additional Tier 1 under paragraph 63.
65. Where capital has been issued to third parties out of a special purpose vehicle
(SPV), none of this capital can be included in Common Equity Tier 1. However, such capital
can be included in consolidated Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 and treated as if the bank itself
had issued the capital directly to the third parties only if it meets all the relevant entry criteria
and the only asset of the SPV is its investment in the capital of the bank in a form that meets
or exceeds all the relevant entry criteria25 (as required by criterion 14 for Additional Tier 1
and criterion 9 for Tier 2). In cases where the capital has been issued to third parties through
an SPV via a fully consolidated subsidiary of the bank, such capital may, subject to the
requirements of this paragraph, be treated as if the subsidiary itself had issued it directly to
the third parties and may be included in the bank’s consolidated Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 in
accordance with the treatment outlined in paragraphs 63 and 64.
5. Regulatory adjustments
66. This section sets out the regulatory adjustments to be applied to regulatory capital.
In most cases these adjustments are applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1.
Goodwill and other intangibles (except mortgage servicing rights)
67. Goodwill and all other intangibles must be deducted in the calculation of Common
Equity Tier 1, including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory
consolidation. With the exception of mortgage servicing rights, the full amount is to be
deducted net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the
25 Assets that relate to the operation of the SPV may be excluded from this assessment if they are de minimis.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 21

--- Page 30 ---

intangible assets become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting
standards. The amount to be deducted in respect of mortgage servicing rights is set out in
the threshold deductions section below.
68. Subject to prior supervisory approval, banks that report under local GAAP may use
the IFRS definition of intangible assets to determine which assets are classified as intangible
and are thus required to be deducted.
Deferred tax assets
69. Deferred tax assets (DTAs) that rely on future profitability of the bank to be realised
are to be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. Deferred tax assets may be
netted with associated deferred tax liabilities (DTLs) only if the DTAs and DTLs relate to
taxes levied by the same taxation authority and offsetting is permitted by the relevant
taxation authority. Where these DTAs relate to temporary differences (eg allowance for credit
losses) the amount to be deducted is set out in the “threshold deductions” section below. All
other such assets, eg those relating to operating losses, such as the carry forward of unused
tax losses, or unused tax credits, are to be deducted in full net of deferred tax liabilities as
described above. The DTLs permitted to be netted against DTAs must exclude amounts that
have been netted against the deduction of goodwill, intangibles and defined benefit pension
assets, and must be allocated on a pro rata basis between DTAs subject to the threshold
deduction treatment and DTAs that are to be deducted in full.
70. An overinstallment of tax or, in some jurisdictions, current year tax losses carried
back to prior years may give rise to a claim or receivable from the government or local tax
authority. Such amounts are typically classified as current tax assets for accounting
purposes. The recovery of such a claim or receivable would not rely on the future profitability
of the bank and would be assigned the relevant sovereign risk weighting.
Cash flow hedge reserve
71. The amount of the cash flow hedge reserve that relates to the hedging of items that
are not fair valued on the balance sheet (including projected cash flows) should be
derecognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1. This means that positive amounts
should be deducted and negative amounts should be added back.
72. This treatment specifically identifies the element of the cash flow hedge reserve that
is to be derecognised for prudential purposes. It removes the element that gives rise to
artificial volatility in common equity, as in this case the reserve only reflects one half of the
picture (the fair value of the derivative, but not the changes in fair value of the hedged future
cash flow).
Shortfall of the stock of provisions to expected losses
73. The deduction from capital in respect of a shortfall of the stock of provisions to
expected losses under the IRB approach should be made in the calculation of Common
Equity Tier 1. The full amount is to be deducted and should not be reduced by any tax effects
that could be expected to occur if provisions were to rise to the level of expected losses.
Gain on sale related to securitisation transactions
74. Derecognise in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 any increase in equity
capital resulting from a securitisation transaction, such as that associated with expected
future margin income (FMI) resulting in a gain-on-sale.
22 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

Cumulative gains and losses due to changes in own credit risk on fair valued financial
liabilities
75. Derecognise in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1, all unrealised gains and
losses that have resulted from changes in the fair value of liabilities that are due to changes
in the bank’s own credit risk.
Defined benefit pension fund assets and liabilities
76. Defined benefit pension fund liabilities, as included on the balance sheet, must be
fully recognised in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 (ie Common Equity Tier 1 cannot
be increased through derecognising these liabilities). For each defined benefit pension fund
that is an asset on the balance sheet, the asset should be deducted in the calculation of
Common Equity Tier 1 net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be
extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognised under the relevant
accounting standards. Assets in the fund to which the bank has unrestricted and unfettered
access can, with supervisory approval, offset the deduction. Such offsetting assets should be
given the risk weight they would receive if they were owned directly by the bank.
77. This treatment addresses the concern that assets arising from pension funds may
not be capable of being withdrawn and used for the protection of depositors and other
creditors of a bank. The concern is that their only value stems from a reduction in future
payments into the fund. The treatment allows for banks to reduce the deduction of the asset
if they can address these concerns and show that the assets can be easily and promptly
withdrawn from the fund.
Investments in own shares (treasury stock)
78. All of a bank’s investments in its own common shares, whether held directly or
indirectly, will be deducted in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1 (unless already
derecognised under the relevant accounting standards). In addition, any own stock which the
bank could be contractually obliged to purchase should be deducted in the calculation of
Common Equity Tier 1. The treatment described will apply irrespective of the location of the
exposure in the banking book or the trading book. In addition:
 Gross long positions may be deducted net of short positions in the same underlying
exposure only if the short positions involve no counterparty risk.
 Banks should look through holdings of index securities to deduct exposures to own
shares. However, gross long positions in own shares resulting from holdings of
index securities may be netted against short position in own shares resulting from
short positions in the same underlying index. In such cases the short positions may
involve counterparty risk (which will be subject to the relevant counterparty credit
risk charge).
This deduction is necessary to avoid the double counting of a bank’s own capital. Certain
accounting regimes do not permit the recognition of treasury stock and so this deduction is
only relevant where recognition on the balance sheet is permitted. The treatment seeks to
remove the double counting that arises from direct holdings, indirect holdings via index funds
and potential future holdings as a result of contractual obligations to purchase own shares.
Following the same approach outlined above, banks must deduct investments in their own
Additional Tier 1 in the calculation of their Additional Tier 1 capital and must deduct
investments in their own Tier 2 in the calculation of their Tier 2 capital.

Reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities
79. Reciprocal cross holdings of capital that are designed to artificially inflate the capital
position of banks will be deducted in full. Banks must apply a “corresponding deduction
approach” to such investments in the capital of other banks, other financial institutions and
insurance entities. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of
capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself.
Investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the
scope of regulatory consolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10% of the
issued common share capital of the entity
80. The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory
consolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10% of the issued common share
capital of the entity. In addition:
 Investments include direct, indirect26 and synthetic holdings of capital instruments.
For example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine
their underlying holdings of capital.27
 Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital
includes common stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments
(eg subordinated debt). It is the net long position that is to be included (ie the gross
long position net of short positions in the same underlying exposure where the
maturity of the short position either matches the maturity of the long position or has
a residual maturity of at least one year).
 Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded.
Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.
 If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet
the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank,
the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory
adjustment.28
 National discretion applies to allow banks, with prior supervisory approval, to
exclude temporarily certain investments where these have been made in the context
of resolving or providing financial assistance to reorganise a distressed institution.
81. If the total of all holdings listed above in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank’s
common equity (after applying all other regulatory adjustments in full listed prior to this one)
then the amount above 10% is required to be deducted, applying a corresponding deduction
approach. This means the deduction should be applied to the same component of capital for
which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself. Accordingly, the amount to
be deducted from common equity should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in
aggregate exceed 10% of the bank’s common equity (as per above) multiplied by the
26 Indirect holdings are exposures or parts of exposures that, if a direct holding loses its value, will result in a loss
to the bank substantially equivalent to the loss in value of the direct holding.
27 If banks find it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor their exact exposure to the capital of
other financial institutions as a result of their holdings of index securities, national authorities may permit
banks, subject to prior supervisory approval, to use a conservative estimate.
28 If the investment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in the
relevant sector of the financial entity, it is not required to be deducted.
24 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 33 ---

common equity holdings as a percentage of the total capital holdings. This would result in a
common equity deduction which corresponds to the proportion of total capital holdings held
in common equity. Similarly, the amount to be deducted from Additional Tier 1 capital should
be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank’s
common equity (as per above) multiplied by the Additional Tier 1 capital holdings as a
percentage of the total capital holdings. The amount to be deducted from Tier 2 capital
should be calculated as the total of all holdings which in aggregate exceed 10% of the bank’s
common equity (as per above) multiplied by the Tier 2 capital holdings as a percentage of
the total capital holdings.
82. If, under the corresponding deduction approach, a bank is required to make a
deduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not have enough of that tier of capital to
satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from the next higher tier of capital (eg if a
bank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will
be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1).
83. Amounts below the threshold, which are not deducted, will continue to be risk
weighted. Thus, instruments in the trading book will be treated as per the market risk rules
and instruments in the banking book should be treated as per the internal ratings-based
approach or the standardised approach (as applicable). For the application of risk weighting
the amount of the holdings must be allocated on a pro rata basis between those below and
those above the threshold.
Significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are
outside the scope of regulatory consolidation29
84. The regulatory adjustment described in this section applies to investments in the
capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory
consolidation where the bank owns more than 10% of the issued common share capital of
the issuing entity or where the entity is an affiliate30 of the bank. In addition:
 Investments include direct, indirect and synthetic holdings of capital instruments. For
example, banks should look through holdings of index securities to determine their
underlying holdings of capital.31
 Holdings in both the banking book and trading book are to be included. Capital
includes common stock and all other types of cash and synthetic capital instruments
(eg subordinated debt). It is the net long position that is to be included (ie the gross
long position net of short positions in the same underlying exposure where the
maturity of the short position either matches the maturity of the long position or has
a residual maturity of at least one year).
29 Investments in entities that are outside of the scope of regulatory consolidation refers to investments in entities
that have not been consolidated at all or have not been consolidated in such a way as to result in their assets
being included in the calculation of consolidated risk-weighted assets of the group.
30 An affiliate of a bank is defined as a company that controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control
with, the bank. Control of a company is defined as (1) ownership, control, or holding with power to vote 20% or
more of a class of voting securities of the company; or (2) consolidation of the company for financial reporting
purposes.
31 If banks find it operationally burdensome to look through and monitor their exact exposure to the capital of
other financial institutions as a result of their holdings of index securities, national authorities may permit
banks, subject to prior supervisory approval, to use a conservative estimate.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 25

--- Page 34 ---

 Underwriting positions held for five working days or less can be excluded.
Underwriting positions held for longer than five working days must be included.
 If the capital instrument of the entity in which the bank has invested does not meet
the criteria for Common Equity Tier 1, Additional Tier 1, or Tier 2 capital of the bank,
the capital is to be considered common shares for the purposes of this regulatory
adjustment.32
 National discretion applies to allow banks, with prior supervisory approval, to
exclude temporarily certain investments where these have been made in the context
of resolving or providing financial assistance to reorganise a distressed institution.
85. All investments included above that are not common shares must be fully deducted
following a corresponding deduction approach. This means the deduction should be applied
to the same tier of capital for which the capital would qualify if it was issued by the bank itself.
If the bank is required to make a deduction from a particular tier of capital and it does not
have enough of that tier of capital to satisfy that deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from
the next higher tier of capital (eg if a bank does not have enough Additional Tier 1 capital to
satisfy the deduction, the shortfall will be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1).
86. Investments included above that are common shares will be subject to the threshold
treatment described in the next section.
Threshold deductions
87. Instead of a full deduction, the following items may each receive limited recognition
when calculating Common Equity Tier 1, with recognition capped at 10% of the bank’s
common equity (after the application of all regulatory adjustments set out in paragraphs 67 to
85):
 Significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial
institutions (banks, insurance and other financial entities) as referred to in paragraph
84;
 Mortgage servicing rights (MSRs); and
 DTAs that arise from temporary differences.
88. On 1 January 2013, a bank must deduct the amount by which the aggregate of the
three items above exceeds 15% of its common equity component of Tier 1 (calculated prior
to the deduction of these items but after application of all other regulatory adjustments
applied in the calculation of Common Equity Tier 1). The items included in the 15%
aggregate limit are subject to full disclosure. As of 1 January 2018, the calculation of the 15%
limit will be subject to the following treatment: the amount of the three items that remains
recognised after the application of all regulatory adjustments must not exceed 15% of the
Common Equity Tier 1 capital, calculated after all regulatory adjustments. See Annex 2 for
an example.
89. The amount of the three items that are not deducted in the calculation of Common
Equity Tier 1 will be risk weighted at 250%.
32 If the investment is issued out of a regulated financial entity and not included in regulatory capital in the
relevant sector of the financial entity, it is not required to be deducted.
26 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 35 ---

Former deductions from capital
90. The following items, which under Basel II were deducted 50% from Tier 1 and 50%
from Tier 2 (or had the option of being deducted or risk weighted), will receive a 1250% risk
weight:
 Certain securitisation exposures;
 Certain equity exposures under the PD/LGD approach;
 Non-payment/delivery on non-DvP and non-PvP transactions; and
 Significant investments in commercial entities.
6. Disclosure requirements
91. To help improve transparency of regulatory capital and improve market discipline,
banks are required to disclose the following:
 a full reconciliation of all regulatory capital elements back to the balance sheet in the
audited financial statements;
 separate disclosure of all regulatory adjustments and the items not deducted from
Common Equity Tier 1 according to paragraphs 87 and 88;
 a description of all limits and minima, identifying the positive and negative elements
of capital to which the limits and minima apply;
 a description of the main features of capital instruments issued;
 banks which disclose ratios involving components of regulatory capital (eg “Equity
Tier 1”, “Core Tier 1” or “Tangible Common Equity” ratios) must accompany such
disclosures with a comprehensive explanation of how these ratios are calculated.
92. Banks are also required to make available on their websites the full terms and
conditions of all instruments included in regulatory capital. The Basel Committee will issue
more detailed Pillar 3 disclosure requirements in 2011.
93. During the transition phase banks are required to disclose the specific components
of capital, including capital instruments and regulatory adjustments that are benefiting from
the transitional provisions.
C. Transitional arrangements
94. The transitional arrangements for implementing the new standards will help to
ensure that the banking sector can meet the higher capital standards through reasonable
earnings retention and capital raising, while still supporting lending to the economy. The
transitional arrangements include:
(a) National implementation by member countries will begin on 1 January 2013.
Member countries must translate the rules into national laws and regulations before
this date. As of 1 January 2013, banks will be required to meet the following new
minimum requirements in relation to risk-weighted assets (RWAs):
– 3.5% Common Equity Tier 1/RWAs;
– 4.5% Tier 1 capital/RWAs, and
– 8.0% total capital/RWAs.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
(b) The minimum Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 requirements will be phased in
between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2015. On 1 January 2013, the minimum
Common Equity Tier 1 requirement will rise from the current 2% level to 3.5%. The
Tier 1 capital requirement will rise from 4% to 4.5%. On 1 January 2014, banks will
have to meet a 4% minimum Common Equity Tier 1 requirement and a Tier 1
requirement of 5.5%. On 1 January 2015, banks will have to meet the 4.5%
Common Equity Tier 1 and the 6% Tier 1 requirements. The total capital
requirement remains at the existing level of 8.0% and so does not need to be
phased in. The difference between the total capital requirement of 8.0% and the
Tier 1 requirement can be met with Tier 2 and higher forms of capital.
(c) The regulatory adjustments (ie deductions and prudential filters), including amounts
above the aggregate 15% limit for significant investments in financial institutions,
mortgage servicing rights, and deferred tax assets from temporary differences,
would be fully deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 by 1 January 2018.
(d) In particular, the regulatory adjustments will begin at 20% of the required
adjustments to Common Equity Tier 1 on 1 January 2014, 40% on 1 January 2015,
60% on 1 January 2016, 80% on 1 January 2017, and reach 100% on 1 January
2018. During this transition period, the remainder not deducted from Common
Equity Tier 1 will continue to be subject to existing national treatments. The same
transition approach will apply to deductions from Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
Specifically, the regulatory adjustments to Additional Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital will
begin at 20% of the required deductions on 1 January 2014, 40% on 1 January
2015, 60% on 1 January 2016, 80% on 1 January 2017, and reach 100% on 1
January 2018. During this transition period, the remainder not deducted from capital
will continue to be subject to existing national treatments.
(e) The treatment of capital issued out of subsidiaries and held by third parties (eg
minority interest) will also be phased in. Where such capital is eligible for inclusion in
one of the three components of capital according to paragraphs 63 to 65, it can be
included from 1 January 2013. Where such capital is not eligible for inclusion in one
of the three components of capital but is included under the existing national
treatment, 20% of this amount should be excluded from the relevant component of
capital on 1 January 2014, 40% on 1 January 2015, 60% on 1 January 2016, 80%
on 1 January 2017, and reach 100% on 1 January 2018.
(f) Existing public sector capital injections will be grandfathered until 1 January 2018.
(g) Capital instruments that no longer qualify as non-common equity Tier 1 capital or
Tier 2 capital will be phased out beginning 1 January 2013. Fixing the base at the
nominal amount of such instruments outstanding on 1 January 2013, their
recognition will be capped at 90% from 1 January 2013, with the cap reducing by
10 percentage points in each subsequent year. This cap will be applied to Additional
Tier 1 and Tier 2 separately and refers to the total amount of instruments
outstanding that no longer meet the relevant entry criteria. To the extent an
instrument is redeemed, or its recognition in capital is amortised, after 1 January
2013, the nominal amount serving as the base is not reduced. In addition,
instruments with an incentive to be redeemed will be treated as follows:
– For an instrument that has a call and a step-up prior to 1 January 2013 (or
another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument is not called at its
effective maturity date and on a forward-looking basis will meet the new
criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will continue to be recognised in that
tier of capital.

– For an instrument that has a call and a step-up on or after 1 January 2013 (or
another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument is not called at its
effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis will meet the new
criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will continue to be recognised in that
tier of capital. Prior to the effective maturity date, the instrument would be
considered an “instrument that no longer qualifies as Additional Tier 1 or Tier
2” and will therefore be phased out from 1 January 2013.
– For an instrument that has a call and a step-up between 12 September 2010
and 1 January 2013 (or another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument is
not called at its effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis does not
meet the new criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will be fully
derecognised in that tier of regulatory capital from 1 January 2013.
– For an instrument that has a call and a step-up on or after 1 January 2013 (or
another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument is not called at its
effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis does not meet the new
criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will be derecognised in that tier of
regulatory capital from the effective maturity date. Prior to the effective
maturity date, the instrument would be considered an “instrument that no
longer qualifies as Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2” and will therefore be phased out
from 1 January 2013.
– For an instrument that had a call and a step-up on or prior to 12 September
2010 (or another incentive to be redeemed), if the instrument was not called at
its effective maturity date and on a forward looking basis does not meet the
new criteria for inclusion in Tier 1 or Tier 2, it will be considered an “instrument
that no longer qualifies as Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2” and will therefore be
phased out from 1 January 2013.
95. Capital instruments that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in Common Equity Tier
1 will be excluded from Common Equity Tier 1 as of 1 January 2013. However, instruments
meeting the following three conditions will be phased out over the same horizon described in
paragraph 94(g): (1) they are issued by a non-joint stock company33; (2) they are treated as
equity under the prevailing accounting standards; and (3) they receive unlimited recognition
as part of Tier 1 capital under current national banking law.
96. Only those instruments issued before 12 September 2010 qualify for the above
transition arrangements.
II. Risk Coverage
A. Counterparty credit risk
97. In addition to raising the quality and level of the capital base, there is a need to
ensure that all material risks are captured in the capital framework. Failure to capture major
on- and off-balance sheet risks, as well as derivative related exposures, was a key factor that
amplified the crisis. This section outlines the reforms to the counterparty credit risk
framework, which become effective on 1 January 2013.
33 Non-joint stock companies were not addressed in the Basel Committee’s 1998 agreement on instruments
eligible for inclusion in Tier 1 capital as they do not issue voting common shares.

1. Revised metric to better address counterparty credit risk, credit valuation
adjustments and wrong-way risk
Effective EPE with stressed parameters to address general wrong-way risk
98. In order to implement these changes, a new paragraph 25(i) will be inserted in
Section V (Internal Model Method: measuring exposure and minimum requirements), Annex
4, of the Basel II framework and the existing paragraph 61 of Annex 4 will be revised as
follows for banks with permission to use the internal models method (IMM) to calculate
counterparty credit risk (CCR) regulatory capital – hereafter referred to as “IMM banks”:
25(i). To determine the default risk capital charge for counterparty credit risk as
defined in paragraph 105, banks must use the greater of the portfolio-level capital
charge (not including the CVA charge in paragraphs 97-104) based on Effective
EPE using current market data and the portfolio-level capital charge based on
Effective EPE using a stress calibration. The stress calibration should be a single
consistent stress calibration for the whole portfolio of counterparties. The greater of
Effective EPE using current market data and the stress calibration should not be
applied on a counterparty by counterparty basis, but on a total portfolio level.
61. When the Effective EPE model is calibrated using historic market data, the
bank must employ current market data to compute current exposures and at least
three years of historical data must be used to estimate parameters of the model.
Alternatively, market implied data may be used to estimate parameters of the model.
In all cases, the data must be updated quarterly or more frequently if market
conditions warrant. To calculate the Effective EPE using a stress calibration, the
bank must also calibrate Effective EPE using three years of data that include a
period of stress to the credit default spreads of a bank’s counterparties or calibrate
Effective EPE using market implied data from a suitable period of stress. The
following process will be used to assess the adequacy of the stress calibration:
 The bank must demonstrate, at least quarterly, that the stress period
coincides with a period of increased CDS or other credit spreads – such as
loan or corporate bond spreads – for a representative selection of the
bank’s counterparties with traded credit spreads. In situations where the
bank does not have adequate credit spread data for a counterparty, the
bank should map each counterparty to specific credit spread data based on
region, internal rating and business types.
 The exposure model for all counterparties must use data, either historic or
implied, that include the data from the stressed credit period, and must use
such data in a manner consistent with the method used for the calibration
of the Effective EPE model to current data.
 To evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration for Effective EPE, the
bank must create several benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the
same main risk factors to which the bank is exposed. The exposure to
these benchmark portfolios shall be calculated using (a) current positions at
current market prices, stressed volatilities, stressed correlations and other
relevant stressed exposure model inputs from the 3-year stress period and
(b) current positions at end of stress period market prices, stressed
volatilities, stressed correlations and other relevant stressed exposure
model inputs from the 3-year stress period. Supervisors may adjust the
stress calibration if the exposures of these benchmark portfolios deviate
substantially.

Capitalisation of the risk of CVA losses
99. To implement the bond equivalent approach, the following new section VIII will be
added to Annex 4 of the Basel II framework. The new paragraphs (97 to 105) are to be
inserted after paragraph 96 in Annex 4.
VIII. Treatment of mark-to-market counterparty risk losses (CVA capital
charge)
- CVA Risk Capital Charge
97. In addition to the default risk capital requirements for counterparty credit risk
determined based on the standardised or internal ratings-based (IRB) approaches
for credit risk, a bank must add a capital charge to cover the risk of mark-to-market
losses on the expected counterparty risk (such losses being known as credit value
adjustments, CVA) to OTC derivatives. The CVA capital charge will be calculated in
the manner set forth below depending on the bank’s approved method of calculating
capital charges for counterparty credit risk and specific interest rate risk. A bank is
not required to include in this capital charge (i) transactions with a central
counterparty (CCP); and (ii) securities financing transactions (SFT), unless their
supervisor determines that the bank’s CVA loss exposures arising from SFT
transactions are material.
A. Banks with IMM approval and Specific Interest Rate Risk VaR model34 approval
for bonds: Advanced CVA risk capital charge
98. Banks with IMM approval for counterparty credit risk and approval to use the
market risk internal models approach for the specific interest-rate risk of bonds must
calculate this additional capital charge by modelling the impact of changes in the
counterparties’ credit spreads on the CVAs of all OTC derivative counterparties,
together with eligible CVA hedges according to new paragraphs 102 and 103, using
the bank’s VaR model for bonds. This VaR model is restricted to changes in the
counterparties’ credit spreads and does not model the sensitivity of CVA to changes
in other market factors, such as changes in the value of the reference asset,
commodity, currency or interest rate of a derivative. Regardless of the accounting
valuation method a bank uses for determining CVA, the CVA capital charge
calculation must be based on the following formula for the CVA of each
counterparty:
T   s t   s t  EE D EE D 
CVALGD Max0;exp i1 i1 exp i i  i1 i1 i i 

Where
 t is the time of the i-th revaluation time bucket, starting from t =0.
i 0
 t is the longest contractual maturity across the netting sets with the
T
counterparty.
34 “VaR model” refers to the internal model approach to market risk.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
 s is the credit spread of the counterparty at tenor t, used to calculate the CVA
i i
of the counterparty. Whenever the CDS spread of the counterparty is
available, this must be used. Whenever such a CDS spread is not available,
the bank must use a proxy spread that is appropriate based on the rating,
industry and region of the counterparty.
 LGD is the loss given default of the counterparty and should be based on
MKT
the spread of a market instrument of the counterparty (or where a counterparty
instrument is not available, based on the proxy spread that is appropriate
based on the rating, industry and region of the counterparty). It should be
noted that this LGD , which inputs into the calculation of the CVA risk capital
MKT
charge, is different from the LGD that is determined for the IRB and CCR
default risk charge, as this LGD is a market assessment rather than an
MKT
internal estimate.
 The first factor within the sum represents an approximation of the market
implied marginal probability of a default occurring between times t and t.
i-1 i
Market implied default probability (also known as risk neutral probability)
represents the market price of buying protection against a default and is in
general different from the real-world likelihood of a default.
 EE is the expected exposure to the counterparty at revaluation time t, as
i i
defined in paragraph 30 (regulatory expected exposure), where exposures of
different netting sets for such counterparty are added, and where the longest
maturity of each netting set is given by the longest contractual maturity inside

4) for margined trades, the paragraph 99 should be applied.

99. The formula in paragraph 98 must be the basis for all inputs into the bank’s
approved VaR model for bonds when calculating the CVA risk capital charge for a
counterparty. For example, if this approved VaR model is based on full repricing,
then the formula must be used directly. If the bank’s approved VaR model is based
on credit spread sensitivities for specific tenors, the bank must base each credit
spread sensitivity on the following formula:35

If the bank’s approved VaR model uses credit spread sensitivities to parallel shifts in

If the bank’s approved VaR model uses second-order sensitivities to shifts in credit
spreads (spread gamma), the gammas must be calculated based on the formula in
paragraph 98.
Banks using the short cut method for collateralised OTC derivatives (paragraph 41
in Appendix 4), must compute the CVA risk capital charge according to paragraph
98, by assuming a constant EE (expected exposure) profile, where EE is set equal
to the effective expected positive exposure of the shortcut method for a maturity
equal to the maximum of (i) half of the longest maturity occurring in the netting set
and (ii) the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions inside the netting
set.
Banks with IMM approval for the majority of their businesses, but which use CEM
(Current Exposure Method) or SM (Standardised Method) for certain smaller
portfolios, and which have approval to use the market risk internal models approach
for the specific interest rate risk of bonds, will include these non-IMM netting sets
into the CVA risk capital charge, according to paragraph 98, unless the national
supervisor decides that paragraph 104 should apply for these portfolios. Non-IMM
netting sets are included into the advanced CVA risk capital charge by assuming a
constant EE profile, where EE is set equal to the EAD as computed under CEM or
SM for a maturity equal to the maximum of (i) half of the longest maturity occurring
in the netting set and (ii) the notional weighted average maturity of all transactions
inside the netting set. The same approach applies where the IMM model does not
produce an expected exposure profile.
For exposures to certain counterparties, the bank's approved market risk VaR model
may not reflect the risk of credit spread changes appropriately, because the bank's
market risk VaR model does not appropriately reflect the specific risk of debt
instruments issued by the counterparty. For such exposures, the bank is not allowed
to use the advanced CVA risk charge. Instead, for these exposures the bank must
determine the CVA risk charge by application of the standardised method in
paragraph 104. Only exposures to counterparties for which the bank has
supervisory approval for modelling the specific risk of debt instruments are to be
included into the advanced CVA risk charge.
100. The CVA risk capital charge consists of both general and specific credit spread
risks, including Stressed VaR but excluding IRC (incremental risk charge). The VaR
figure should be determined in accordance with the quantitative standards described
in paragraph 718(Lxxvi). It is thus determined as the sum of (i) the non-stressed
VaR component and (ii) the stressed VaR component.
i. When calculating the non stressed VaR, current parameter calibrations for
expected exposure must be used.
ii. When calculating the stressed VaR future counterparty EE profiles (according
to the stressed exposure parameter calibrations as defined in paragraph 61 of
Annex 4) must be used. The period of stress for the credit spread parameters

should be the most severe one-year stress period contained within the three-
year stress period used for the exposure parameters.37
101. This additional CVA risk capital charge is the standalone market risk charge,
calculated on the set of CVAs (as specified in paragraph 98) for all OTC derivatives
counterparties, collateralised and uncollateralised, together with eligible CVA
hedges. Within this standalone CVA risk capital charge, no offset against other
instruments on the bank’s balance sheet will be permitted (except as otherwise
expressly provided herein).
102. Only hedges used for the purpose of mitigating CVA risk, and managed as
such, are eligible to be included in the VaR model used to calculate the above CVA
capital charge or in the standardised CVA risk capital charge set forth in paragraph
104. For example, if a credit default swap (CDS) referencing an issuer is in the
bank’s inventory and that issuer also happens to be an OTC counterparty but the
CDS is not managed as a hedge of CVA, then such a CDS is not eligible to offset
the CVA within the standalone VaR calculation of the CVA risk capital charge.
103. The only eligible hedges that can be included in the calculation of the CVA risk
capital charge under paragraphs 98 or 104 are single-name CDSs, single-name
contingent CDSs, other equivalent hedging instruments referencing the counterparty
directly, and index CDSs. In case of index CDSs, the following restrictions apply:
 The basis between any individual counterparty spread and the spreads of
index CDS hedges must be reflected in the VaR. This requirement also
applies to cases where a proxy is used for the spread of a counterparty, since
idiosyncratic basis still needs to be reflected in such situations. For all
counterparties with no available spread, the bank must use reasonable basis
time series out of a representative bucket of similar names for which a spread
is available.
 If the basis is not reflected to the satisfaction of the supervisor, then the bank
must reflect only 50% of the notional amount of index hedges in the VaR.
Other types of counterparty risk hedges must not be reflected within the calculation
of the CVA capital charge, and these other hedges must be treated as any other
instrument in the bank’s inventory for regulatory capital purposes. Tranched or nth-
to-default CDSs are not eligible CVA hedges. Eligible hedges that are included in
the CVA capital charge must be removed from the bank’s market risk capital charge
calculation.
B. All other banks: standardised CVA risk capital charge
104. When a bank does not have the required approvals to use paragraph 98 to
calculate a CVA capital charge for its counterparties, the bank must calculate a
portfolio capital charge using the following formula:
37 Note that the three-times multiplier inherent in the calculation of a bond VaR and a stressed VaR will apply to
these calculations.

105. Calculation of the aggregate CCR and CVA risk capital charges
This paragraph deals with the aggregation of the default risk capital charge and the
CVA risk capital charge for potential mark-to-market losses. Note that outstanding
EAD referred to in the default risk capital charges below is net of incurred CVA
losses according to [new paragraph after Para 9 in Annex 4], which affects all items
“i” below. In this paragraph, “IMM capital charge” refers to the default risk capital
charge for CCR based on the RWAs obtained when multiplying the outstanding EAD
of each counterparty under the IMM approach by the applicable credit risk weight
(under the Standardised or IRB approach), and summing across counterparties.
Equally, “CEM capital charge” or “SM capital charge” refer to the default risk capital
charges where outstanding EADs for all counterparties in the portfolio are
determined based on CEM or SM, respectively.
A. Banks with IMM approval and market-risk internal-models approval for the
specific interest-rate risk of bonds
The total CCR capital charge for such a bank is determined as the sum of the
following components:
i. The higher of (a) its IMM capital charge based on current parameter
calibrations for EAD and (b) its IMM capital charge based on stressed
parameter calibrations for EAD. For IRB banks, the risk weights applied to
OTC derivative exposures should be calculated with the full maturity
adjustment as a function of PD and M set equal to 1 in the Basel Accord
(paragraph 272), provided the bank can demonstrate to its national supervisor
that its specific VaR model applied in paragraph 98 contains effects of rating
migrations. If the bank cannot demonstrate this to the satisfaction of its

any preferences or determinations on external assessment institutions by the Committee.

national supervisor, the full maturity adjustment function, given by the formula
(1 – 1.5 x b)^-1 × (1 + (M – 2.5) × b)39 should apply.
ii. The advanced CVA risk capital charge determined pursuant to paragraphs 98
to 103.
B. Banks with IMM approval and without Specific Risk VaR approval for bonds
The total CCR capital charge for such a bank is determined as the sum of the
following components:
i. The higher of (a) the IMM capital charge based on current parameter
calibrations for EAD and (b) the IMM capital charge based on stressed
parameter calibrations for EAD.
ii. The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined by paragraph 104.
C. All other banks
The total CCR capital charge for such banks is determined as the sum of the
following two components:
i. The sum over all counterparties of the CEM or SM based capital charge
(depending on the bank’s CCR approach) with EADs determined by
paragraphs 91or 69 respectively.
ii. The standardised CVA risk capital charge determined by paragraph 104.
In addition, the following paragraph will be inserted after paragraph 9 in Annex 4.
“Outstanding EAD” for a given OTC derivative counterparty is defined as the greater of zero
and the difference between the sum of EADs across all netting sets with the counterparty
and the credit valuation adjustment (CVA) for that counterparty which has already been
recognised by the bank as an incurred write-down (ie a CVA loss). This CVA loss is
calculated without taking into account any offsetting debit valuation adjustments which have
been deducted from capital under paragraph 75.40 RWAs for a given OTC derivative
counterparty may be calculated as the applicable risk weight under the Standardised or IRB
approach multiplied by the outstanding EAD of the counterparty. This reduction of EAD by
incurred CVA losses does not apply to the determination of the CVA risk capital charge.
Wrong-way risk
100. Paragraph 57 of Annex 4 in Basel II will be revised as follows:
57. Banks must identify exposures that give rise to a greater degree of general
wrong-way risk. Stress testing and scenario analyses must be designed to identify
39 Where “M” is the effective maturity and “b” is the maturity adjustment as a function of the PD, as defined in
paragraph 272 of the Basel Accord.
40 The incurred CVA loss deduced from exposures to determine outstanding EAD is the CVA loss gross of all
debit value adjustments (DVA) which have been separately deducted from capital. To the extent DVA has not
been separately deducted from a bank’s capital, the incurred CVA loss used to determine outstanding EAD
will be net of such DVA.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
risk factors that are positively correlated with counterparty credit worthiness. Such
testing needs to address the possibility of severe shocks occurring when
relationships between risk factors have changed. Banks should monitor general
wrong way risk by product, by region, by industry, or by other categories that are
germane to the business. Reports should be provided to senior management and
the appropriate committee of the Board on a regular basis that communicate wrong
way risks and the steps that are being taken to manage that risk.
Implement an explicit Pillar 1 capital charge and revise Annex 4 where specific wrong-way
risk has been identified
101. In order to implement the requirement that the EAD calculation reflect a higher EAD
value for counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified, paragraph 423 of
the Basel II text and paragraphs 29 and 58 of Annex 4 will be revised as follows:
423. Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately
rated. A bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the
treatment of individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under
which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities.
Those policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way
risk for each legal entity to which the bank is exposed. Transactions with
counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated
differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 58, Annex
4).
29. When using an internal model, exposure amount or EAD is calculated as
the product of alpha times Effective EPE, as specified below (except for
counterparties that have been identified as having explicit specific wrong way risk –
see paragraph 58):
58. A bank is exposed to “specific wrong-way risk” if future exposure to a
specific counterparty is highly correlated with the counterparty’s probability of
default. For example, a company writing put options on its own stock creates wrong-
way exposures for the buyer that is specific to the counterparty. A bank must have
procedures in place to identify, monitor and control cases of specific wrong way risk,
beginning at the inception of a trade and continuing through the life of the trade. To
calculate the CCR capital charge, the instruments for which there exists a legal
connection between the counterparty and the underlying issuer, and for which
specific wrong way risk has been identified, are not considered to be in the same
netting set as other transactions with the counterparty. Furthermore, for single-name
credit default swaps where there exists a legal connection between the counterparty
and the underlying issuer, and where specific wrong way risk has been identified,
EAD in respect of such swap counterparty exposure equals the full expected loss in
the remaining fair value of the underlying instruments assuming the underlying
issuer is in liquidation. The use of the full expected loss in remaining fair value of the
underlying instrument allows the bank to recognise, in respect of such swap, the
market value that has been lost already and any expected recoveries. Accordingly
LGD for Advanced or Foundation IRB banks must be set to 100% for such swap
transactions.41 For banks using the Standardised Approach, the risk weight to use is
41 Note that the recoveries may also be possible on the underlying instrument beneath such swap. The capital
requirements for such underlying exposure are to be calculated under the Accord without reduction for the
swap which introduces wrong way risk. Generally this means that such underlying exposure will receive the
38 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
that of an unsecured transaction. For equity derivatives, bond options, securities
financing transactions etc. referencing a single company where there exists a legal
connection between the counterparty and the underlying company, and where
specific wrong way risk has been identified, EAD equals the value of the transaction
under the assumption of a jump-to-default of the underlying security. Inasmuch this
makes re-use of possibly existing (market risk) calculations (for IRC) that already
contain an LGD assumption, the LGD must be set to 100%.
2. Asset value correlation multiplier for large financial institutions
102. In order to implement the AVC multiplier, paragraph 272 of the Basel framework
would be revised as follows:
272. Throughout this section, PD and LGD are measured as decimals, and EAD
is measured as currency (eg euros), except where explicitly noted otherwise. For
exposures not in default, the formula for calculating risk-weighted assets is:42
Correlation (R) = 0.12 × (1 – EXP(-50 × PD)) / (1 – EXP(-50)) +
0.24 × [1 – (1 – EXP(-50 × PD)) / (1 – EXP(-50))]
Maturity adjustment (b) = (0.11852 – 0.05478 × ln(PD))^2
Capital requirement43 (K) = [LGD × N[(1 – R)^-0.5 × G(PD) + (R / (1 –
R))^0.5 × G(0.999)] – PD x LGD] x (1 – 1.5 x b)^-1 × (1 +
(M – 2.5) × b)
Risk-weighted assets (RWA) = K x 12.5 x EAD
The capital requirement (K) for a defaulted exposure is equal to the greater of zero
and the difference between its LGD (described in paragraph 468) and the bank’s
best estimate of expected loss (described in paragraph 471). The risk-weighted
asset amount for the defaulted exposure is the product of K, 12.5, and the EAD.
A multiplier of 1.25 is applied to the correlation parameter of all exposures to
financial institutions meeting the following criteria:
- Regulated financial institutions whose total assets are greater than or equal to
US $100 billion. The most recent audited financial statement of the parent
company and consolidated subsidiaries must be used in order to determine
asset size. For the purpose of this paragraph, a regulated financial institution
is defined as a parent and its subsidiaries where any substantial legal entity in
risk weight and capital treatment associated with an unsecured transaction (ie assuming such underlying
exposure is an unsecured credit exposure).
42 Ln denotes the natural logarithm.
N(x) denotes the cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable (ie the probability that
a normal random variable with mean zero and variance of one is less than or equal to x). G(z) denotes the
inverse cumulative distribution function for a standard normal random variable (ie the value of x such that
N(x) = z). The normal cumulative distribution function and the inverse of the normal cumulative distribution
function are, for example, available in Excel as the functions NORMSDIST and NORMSINV.
43 If this calculation results in a negative capital charge for any individual sovereign exposure, banks should
apply a zero capital charge for that exposure.

the consolidated group is supervised by a regulator that imposes prudential
requirements consistent with international norms. These include, but are not
limited to, prudentially regulated Insurance Companies, Broker/Dealers,
Banks, Thrifts and Futures Commission Merchants;
- Unregulated financial institutions, regardless of size. Unregulated financial
institutions are, for the purposes of this paragraph, legal entities whose main
business includes: the management of financial assets, lending, factoring,
leasing, provision of credit enhancements, securitisation, investments,
financial custody, central counterparty services, proprietary trading and other
financial services activities identified by supervisors.
Correlation (R_FI) = 1.25 x [0.12 x (1 - EXP(-50 x PD)) / (1 - EXP(-50))+
0.24 x [1 - (1 - EXP(-50xPD)) / (1 - EXP(-50))]]
3. Collateralised counterparties and margin period of risk
Increase the margin period of risk
103. In order to implement the increased margin periods of risk, the following new
paragraphs 41(i) and 41 (ii) will be inserted into Annex 4 of the Basel II framework:
41(i). For transactions subject to daily re-margining and mark-to-market
valuation, a supervisory floor of five business days for netting sets consisting only of
repo-style transactions, and 10 business days for all other netting sets is imposed
on the margin period of risk used for the purpose of modelling EAD with margin
agreements. In the following cases a higher supervisory floor is imposed:
 For all netting sets where the number of trades exceeds 5,000 at any point
during a quarter, a supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the
margin period of risk for the following quarter.
 For netting sets containing one or more trades involving either illiquid
collateral, or an OTC derivative that cannot be easily replaced, a
supervisory floor of 20 business days is imposed for the margin period of
risk. For these purposes, “Illiquid collateral” and “OTC derivatives that
cannot be easily replaced” must be determined in the context of stressed
market conditions and will be characterised by the absence of continuously
active markets where a counterparty would, within two or fewer days,
obtain multiple price quotations that would not move the market or
represent a price reflecting a market discount (in the case of collateral) or
premium (in the case of an OTC derivative). Examples of situations where
trades are deemed illiquid for this purpose include, but are not limited to,
trades that are not marked daily and trades that are subject to specific
accounting treatment for valuation purposes (eg OTC derivatives or repo-
style transactions referencing securities whose fair value is determined by
models with inputs that are not observed in the market).
 In addition, a bank must consider whether trades or securities it holds as
collateral are concentrated in a particular counterparty and if that
counterparty exited the market precipitously whether the bank would be
able to replace its trades.
41 (ii). If a bank has experienced more than two margin call disputes on a
particular netting set over the previous two quarters that have lasted longer than the
applicable margin period of risk (before consideration of this provision), then the
40 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
bank must reflect this history appropriately by using a margin period of risk that is at
least double the supervisory floor for that netting set for the subsequent two
quarters.
41 (iii). For re-margining with a periodicity of N-days, irrespective of the shortcut
method or full IMM model, the margin period of risk should be at least equal to the
supervisory floor, F, plus the N days minus one day. That is,
Margin Period of Risk = F + N - 1.
Paragraph 167 of Basel II (Adjustment for different holding periods and non daily mark-to-
market or remargining) will be replaced with the following:
167. The minimum holding period for various products is summarised in the
following table.
Transaction type Minimum holding period Condition
Repo-style transaction five business days daily remargining
Other capital market transactions ten business days daily remargining
Secured lending twenty business days daily revaluation
Where a bank has such a transaction or netting set which meets the criteria outlined
in paragraphs 41(i) or 41 (ii) of Annex 4, the minimum holding period should be the
margin period of risk that would apply under those paragraphs.
Paragraph 179 of Basel II (Use of models) will be replaced with the following:
179. The quantitative and qualitative criteria for recognition of internal market risk
models for repo-style transactions and other similar transactions are in principle the
same as in paragraphs 718 (LXXIV) to 718 (LXXVI). With regard to the holding
period, the minimum will be 5-business days for repo-style transactions, rather than
the 10-business days in paragraph 718 (LXXVI) (c). For other transactions eligible
for the VaR models approach, the 10-business day holding period will be retained.
The minimum holding period should be adjusted upwards for market instruments
where such a holding period would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the
instrument concerned. At a minimum, where a bank has a repo-style or similar
transaction or netting set which meets the criteria outlined in paragraphs 41(i) or 41
(ii) of Annex 4, the minimum holding period should be the margin period of risk that
would apply under those paragraphs, in combination with paragraph 41(iii).
Revise the shortcut method for estimating Effective EPE
104. Paragraph 41 of Annex 4 in Basel II will be revised as follows:
41. Shortcut method: a bank that can model EPE without margin agreements
but cannot achieve the higher level of modelling sophistication to model EPE with
margin agreements can use the following method for margined counterparties
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 41

--- Page 50 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
subject to re-margining and daily mark-to-market as described in paragraph 41 (i).44
The method is a simple approximation to Effective EPE and sets Effective EPE for a
margined counterparty equal to the lesser of:
a) Effective EPE without any held or posted margining collateral, plus any
collateral that has been posted to the counterparty independent of the daily
valuation and margining process or current exposure (ie initial margin or
independent amount); or
b) An add-on that reflects the potential increase in exposure over the margin
period of risk plus the larger of
i. the current exposure net of and including all collateral currently held or
posted, excluding any collateral called or in dispute; or
ii. the largest net exposure including all collateral held or posted under the
margin agreement that would not trigger a collateral call. This amount
should reflect all applicable thresholds, minimum transfer amounts,
independent amounts and initial margins under the margin agreement.
The add-on is calculated as E[max(ΔMtM, 0)], where E[…] is the
expectation (ie the average over scenarios) and ΔMtM is the possible
change of the mark-to-market value of the transactions during the margin
period of risk. Changes in the value of collateral need to be reflected using
the supervisory haircut method or the internal estimates method, but no
collateral payments are assumed during the margin period of risk. The
margin period of risk is subject to the supervisory floor specified in
paragraphs 41(i) to 41(iii). Backtesting should test whether realised
(current) exposures are consistent with the shortcut method prediction over
all margin periods within one year. If some of the trades in the netting set
have a maturity of less than one year, and the netting set has higher risk
factor sensitivities without these trades, this fact should be taken into
account. If backtesting indicates that effective EPE is underestimated, the
bank should take actions to make the method more conservative, eg by
scaling up risk factor moves.
Preclude downgrade triggers from being reflected in EAD
105. In order to explicitly disallow downgrade triggers in EAD, a new paragraph 41(iv) will
be inserted into Annex 4 to read as follows:
41(iv). Banks using the internal models method must not capture the effect of a
reduction of EAD due to any clause in a collateral agreement that requires receipt of
collateral when counterparty credit quality deteriorates.
Add requirements to improve the operational performance of the collateral department
106. To implement the requirements designed to improve the collateral department
operations, two new paragraphs, 51(i) and 51(ii), will be incorporated into Annex 4 and
44 Where a bank generally uses this shortcut method to measure Effective EPE, this shortcut method may be
used by a bank that is a clearing member in a CCP for its transactions with the CCP and with clients, including
those client transactions that result in back-to-back trades with a CCP.

paragraph 777(x), Part 3: The Second Pillar – Supervisory Review Process, will be revised
as follows:
51(i). Banks applying the internal model method must have a collateral
management unit that is responsible for calculating and making margin calls,
managing margin call disputes and reporting levels of independent amounts, initial
margins and variation margins accurately on a daily basis. This unit must control the
integrity of the data used to make margin calls, and ensure that it is consistent and
reconciled regularly with all relevant sources of data within the bank. This unit must
also track the extent of reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash) and the rights
that the bank gives away to its respective counterparties for the collateral that it
posts. These internal reports must indicate the categories of collateral assets that
are reused, and the terms of such reuse including instrument, credit quality and
maturity. The unit must also track concentration to individual collateral asset classes
accepted by the banks. Senior management must allocate sufficient resources to
this unit for its systems to have an appropriate level of operational performance, as
measured by the timeliness and accuracy of outgoing calls and response time to
incoming calls. Senior management must ensure that this unit is adequately staffed
to process calls and disputes in a timely manner even under severe market crisis,
and to enable the bank to limit its number of large disputes caused by trade
volumes.
51(ii). The bank’s collateral management unit must produce and maintain
appropriate collateral management information that is reported on a regular basis to
senior management. Such internal reporting should include information on the type
of collateral (both cash and non-cash) received and posted, as well as the size,
aging and cause for margin call disputes. This internal reporting should also reflect
trends in these figures.
777(x). The bank must conduct an independent review of the CCR management
system regularly through its own internal auditing process. This review must include
both the activities of the business credit and trading units and of the independent
CCR control unit. A review of the overall CCR management process must take place
at regular intervals (ideally not less than once a year) and must specifically address,
at a minimum:
 the adequacy of the documentation of the CCR management system and
process;
 the organisation of the collateral management unit;
 the organisation of the CCR control unit;
 the integration of CCR measures into daily risk management;
 the approval process for risk pricing models and valuation systems used by
front and back-office personnel;
 the validation of any significant change in the CCR measurement process;
 the scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk measurement
model;
 the integrity of the management information system;
 the accuracy and completeness of CCR data;
 the accurate reflection of legal terms in collateral and netting agreements
into exposure measurements;

 the verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data sources
used to run internal models, including the independence of such data
sources;
 the accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation assumptions;
 the accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; and
 the verification of the model’s accuracy through frequent backtesting.
Requirements on the controls around the reuse of collateral by IMM banks
107. To implement the requirements on controls regarding the reuse of collateral, a new
paragraph 51(iii) will be included in Annex 4 as follows:
51(iii). A bank employing the internal models method must ensure that its cash
management policies account simultaneously for the liquidity risks of potential
incoming margin calls in the context of exchanges of variation margin or other
margin types, such as initial or independent margin, under adverse market shocks,
potential incoming calls for the return of excess collateral posted by counterparties,
and calls resulting from a potential downgrade of its own public rating. The bank
must ensure that the nature and horizon of collateral reuse is consistent with its
liquidity needs and does not jeopardise its ability to post or return collateral in a
timely manner.
Require banks to use supervisory haircuts when transforming non-cash OTC collateral into
cash-equivalent.
108. To implement the supervisory haircuts for non-cash OTC collateral, a new
paragraph 61(i) would be incorporated in Annex 4 as follows:
61(i). For a bank to recognise in its EAD calculations for OTC derivatives the
effect of collateral other than cash of the same currency as the exposure itself, if it is
not able to model collateral jointly with the exposure then it must use either haircuts
that meet the standards of the financial collateral comprehensive method with own
haircut estimates or the standard supervisory haircuts.
Requirement for banks to model non-cash collateral jointly with underlying securities for OTC
Derivatives and SFTs.
109. To ensure the robustness of non-cash collateral, a new paragraph 61(ii) will be
inserted in Annex 4 as follows:
61(ii). If the internal model includes the effect of collateral on changes in the
market value of the netting set, the bank must model collateral other than cash of
the same currency as the exposure itself jointly with the exposure in its EAD
calculations for securities-financing transactions.
Revise credit risk mitigation section to add a qualitative collateral management requirement
110. To ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the orderly operation of margin
agreements for OTC derivative and SFT counterparties, and that appropriate collateral
management policies are in place, a new paragraph 115(i) will be inserted into the main text
and will read as follows:
115(i). Banks must ensure that sufficient resources are devoted to the orderly
operation of margin agreements with OTC derivative and securities-financing
44 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

counterparties, as measured by the timeliness and accuracy of its outgoing calls and
response time to incoming calls. Banks must have collateral management policies in
place to control, monitor and report:
 the risk to which margin agreements exposes them (such as the volatility
and liquidity of the securities exchanged as collateral),
 the concentration risk to particular types of collateral,
 the reuse of collateral (both cash and non-cash) including the potential
liquidity shortfalls resulting from the reuse of collateral received from
counterparties, and
 the surrender of rights on collateral posted to counterparties.
Revise text to establish standard supervisory haircuts for securitisation collateral
111. To implement the supervisory haircuts for securitisation collateral, a new paragraph
145(i) will be inserted into the Basel text and paragraph 151 will be revised as follows:
145(i). Re-securitisations (as defined in the securitisation framework), irrespective
of any credit ratings, are not eligible financial collateral. This prohibition applies
whether the bank is using the supervisory haircuts method, the own estimates of
haircuts method, the repo VaR method or the internal model method.
151. These are the standardised supervisory haircuts (assuming daily mark-to-
market, daily remargining and a 10-business day holding period), expressed as
percentages:

(The footnotes associated with the table are not included. However, securitisation exposures would be defined
as those exposures that meet the definition set forth in the securitisation framework.)
Treatment of highly leveraged counterparties
112. The Committee believes it is appropriate to add a qualitative requirement indicating
that the PD estimates for highly leveraged counterparties should reflect the performance of
their assets based on a stressed period and, thus, is introducing a new paragraph after 415
of the framework to read as follows:
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 45

--- Page 54 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
415(i). PD estimates for borrowers that are highly leveraged or for borrowers whose
assets are predominantly traded assets must reflect the performance of the
underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities.
4. Central counterparties
113. The Committee acknowledges the ongoing work of the Committee on Payment and
Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions
(IOSCO) to review the 2004 CPSS-IOSCO Recommendations for Central Counterparties.
Subject to the completion of the revision of the CPSS-IOSCO standards, which cover, among
other things, the risk management of a CCP, the Committee will apply a regulatory capital
treatment for exposures to CCPs based in part on the compliance of the CCP with the
enhanced CPSS-IOSCO standards. The Committee separately will issue for public
consultation a set of rules relating to the capitalisation of bank exposures to central
counterparties (CCPs). This set of standards will be finalised during 2011, once such
consultation and an impact study are complete and after CPSS-IOSCO has completed the
update of its standards applicable to CCPs. The Committee intends for these standards to
come into effect at the same time as other counterparty credit risk reforms.
5. Enhanced counterparty credit risk management requirements
114. Paragraph 36 of Annex 4 will be revised as follows to increase the robustness of
banks’ own estimates of alpha.
36. To this end, banks must ensure that the numerator and denominator of
alpha are computed in a consistent fashion with respect to the modelling
methodology, parameter specifications and portfolio composition. The approach
used must be based on the bank’s internal economic capital approach, be well-
documented and be subject to independent validation. In addition, banks must
review their estimates on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when the
composition of the portfolio varies over time. Banks must assess the model risk and
supervisors should be alert to the significant variation in estimates of alpha that
arises from the possibility for mis-specification in the models used for the numerator,
especially where convexity is present.
Stress testing
115. The qualitative requirements set forth in Annex 4 for stress testing that banks must
perform when using the internal model method have been expanded and made more explicit.
More specifically, the existing paragraph 56, Annex 4, of the Basel II text will be replaced
with the following:
56. Banks must have a comprehensive stress testing program for counterparty
credit risk. The stress testing program must include the following elements:
 Banks must ensure complete trade capture and exposure aggregation
across all forms of counterparty credit risk (not just OTC derivatives) at the
counterparty-specific level in a sufficient time frame to conduct regular
stress testing.
 For all counterparties, banks should produce, at least monthly, exposure
stress testing of principal market risk factors (eg interest rates, FX, equities,
credit spreads, and commodity prices) in order to proactively identify, and
when necessary, reduce outsized concentrations to specific directional
sensitivities.
46 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 55 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
 Banks should apply multifactor stress testing scenarios and assess material
non-directional risks (ie yield curve exposure, basis risks, etc) at least
quarterly. Multiple-factor stress tests should, at a minimum, aim to address
scenarios in which a) severe economic or market events have occurred; b)
broad market liquidity has decreased significantly; and c) the market impact
of liquidating positions of a large financial intermediary. These stress tests
may be part of bank-wide stress testing.
 Stressed market movements have an impact not only on counterparty
exposures, but also on the credit quality of counterparties. At least
quarterly, banks should conduct stress testing applying stressed conditions
to the joint movement of exposures and counterparty creditworthiness.
 Exposure stress testing (including single factor, multifactor and material
non-directional risks) and joint stressing of exposure and creditworthiness
should be performed at the counterparty-specific, counterparty group (eg
industry and region), and aggregate bank-wide CCR levels.
 Stress tests results should be integrated into regular reporting to senior
management. The analysis should capture the largest counterparty-level
impacts across the portfolio, material concentrations within segments of the
portfolio (within the same industry or region), and relevant portfolio and
counterparty specific trends.
 The severity of factor shocks should be consistent with the purpose of the
stress test. When evaluating solvency under stress, factor shocks should
be severe enough to capture historical extreme market environments
and/or extreme but plausible stressed market conditions. The impact of
such shocks on capital resources should be evaluated, as well as the
impact on capital requirements and earnings. For the purpose of day-to-day
portfolio monitoring, hedging, and management of concentrations, banks
should also consider scenarios of lesser severity and higher probability.
 Banks should consider reverse stress tests to identify extreme, but
plausible, scenarios that could result in significant adverse outcomes.
 Senior management must take a lead role in the integration of stress
testing into the risk management framework and risk culture of the bank
and ensure that the results are meaningful and proactively used to manage
counterparty credit risk. At a minimum, the results of stress testing for
significant exposures should be compared to guidelines that express the
bank’s risk appetite and elevated for discussion and action when excessive
or concentrated risks are present.
Model validation and backtesting
116. On model validation, the following paragraph (currently in paragraph 42) will be
moved after paragraph 40 of Annex 4:
40bis. An EPE model must also include transaction-specific information in order to
capture the effects of margining. It must take into account both the current
amount of margin and margin that would be passed between counterparties
in the future. Such a model must account for the nature of margin
agreements (unilateral or bilateral), the frequency of margin calls, the
margin period of risk, the thresholds of unmargined exposure the bank is
willing to accept, and the minimum transfer amount. Such a model must
either model the mark-to-market change in the value of collateral posted or
apply this Framework’s rules for collateral.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
117. The current Basel II requirements for backtesting will be replaced with the following:
42. It is important that supervisory authorities are able to assure themselves
that banks using models have counterparty credit risk management systems that are
conceptually sound and implemented with integrity. Accordingly the supervisory
authority will specify a number of qualitative criteria that banks would have to meet
before they are permitted to use a models-based approach. The extent to which
banks meet the qualitative criteria may influence the level at which supervisory
authorities will set the multiplication factor referred to in paragraph 32 (Alpha) above.
Only those banks in full compliance with the qualitative criteria will be eligible for
application of the minimum multiplication factor. The qualitative criteria include:
 The bank must conduct a regular programme of backtesting, ie an ex-post
comparison of the risk measures45 generated by the model against realised
risk measures, as well as comparing hypothetical changes based on static
positions with realised measures.
 The bank must carry out an initial validation and an on-going periodic
review of its IMM model and the risk measures generated by it. The
validation and review must be independent of the model developers.
 The board of directors and senior management should be actively involved
in the risk control process and must regard credit and counterparty credit
risk control as an essential aspect of the business to which significant
resources need to be devoted. In this regard, the daily reports prepared by
the independent risk control unit must be reviewed by a level of
management with sufficient seniority and authority to enforce both
reductions of positions taken by individual traders and reductions in the
bank’s overall risk exposure.
 The bank’s internal risk measurement exposure model must be closely
integrated into the day-to-day risk management process of the bank. Its
output should accordingly be an integral part of the process of planning,
monitoring and controlling the bank’s counterparty credit risk profile.
 The risk measurement system should be used in conjunction with internal
trading and exposure limits. In this regard, exposure limits should be
related to the bank’s risk measurement model in a manner that is
consistent over time and that is well understood by traders, the credit
function and senior management.
 Banks should have a routine in place for ensuring compliance with a
documented set of internal policies, controls and procedures concerning
the operation of the risk measurement system. The bank’s risk
measurement system must be well documented, for example, through a
risk management manual that describes the basic principles of the risk
management system and that provides an explanation of the empirical
techniques used to measure counterparty credit risk.
 An independent review of the risk measurement system should be carried
out regularly in the bank’s own internal auditing process. This review should
45 “Risk measures” refers not only to Effective EPE, the risk measure used to derive regulatory capital, but also
to the other risk measures used in the calculation of Effective EPE such as the exposure distribution at a
series of future dates, the positive exposure distribution at a series of future dates, the market risk factors
used to derive those exposures and the values of the constituent trades of a portfolio.

include both the activities of the business trading units and of the
independent risk control unit. A review of the overall risk management
process should take place at regular intervals (ideally no less than once a
year) and should specifically address, at a minimum:
 The adequacy of the documentation of the risk management system
and process;
 The organisation of the risk control unit;
 The integration of counterparty credit risk measures into daily risk
management;
 The approval process for counterparty credit risk models used in the
calculation of counterparty credit risk used by front office and back
office personnel;
 The validation of any significant change in the risk measurement
process;
 The scope of counterparty credit risks captured by the risk
measurement model;
 The integrity of the management information system;
 The accuracy and completeness of position data;
 The verification of the consistency, timeliness and reliability of data
sources used to run internal models, including the independence of
such data sources;
 The accuracy and appropriateness of volatility and correlation
assumptions;
 The accuracy of valuation and risk transformation calculations; and
 The verification of the model’s accuracy as described below in
paragraphs 43-46.
 The on-going validation of counterparty credit risk models, including
backtesting, must be reviewed periodically by a level of management with
sufficient authority to decide the course of action that will be taken to
address weaknesses in the models.
43. Banks must document the process for initial and on-going validation of their
IMM model to a level of detail that would enable a third party to recreate the
analysis. Banks must also document the calculation of the risk measures generated
by the models to a level of detail that would allow a third party to re-create the risk
measures. This documentation must set out the frequency with which backtesting
analysis and any other on-going validation will be conducted, how the validation is
conducted with respect to dataflows and portfolios and the analyses that are used.
44. Banks must define criteria with which to assess their EPE models and the
models that input into the calculation of EPE and have a written policy in place that
describes the process by which unacceptable performance will be determined and
remedied.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 49

--- Page 58 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
45. Banks must define how representative counterparty portfolios are
constructed for the purposes of validating an EPE model and its risk measures.
46. When validating EPE models and its risk measures that produce forecast
distributions, validation must assess more than a single statistic of the model
distribution.
46(i) As part of the initial and on-going validation of an IMM model and its risk
measures, the following requirements must be met:
 A bank must carry out backtesting using historical data on movements in
market risk factors prior to supervisory approval. Backtesting must consider
a number of distinct prediction time horizons out to at least one year, over a
range of various start (initialisation) dates and covering a wide range of
market conditions.
 Banks must backtest the performance of their EPE model and the model’s
relevant risk measures as well as the market risk factor predictions that
support EPE. For collateralised trades, the prediction time horizons
considered must include those reflecting typical margin periods of risk
applied in collateralised/margined trading, and must include long time
horizons of at least 1 year.
 The pricing models used to calculate counterparty credit risk exposure for a
given scenario of future shocks to market risk factors must be tested as
part of the initial and on-going model validation process. These pricing
models may be different from those used to calculate Market Risk over a
short horizon. Pricing models for options must account for the nonlinearity
of option value with respect to market risk factors.
 An EPE model must capture transaction specific information in order to
aggregate exposures at the level of the netting set. Banks must verify that
transactions are assigned to the appropriate netting set within the model.
 Static, historical backtesting on representative counterparty portfolios must
be a part of the validation process. At regular intervals as directed by its
supervisor, a bank must conduct such backtesting on a number of
representative counterparty portfolios. The representative portfolios must
be chosen based on their sensitivity to the material risk factors and
correlations to which the bank is exposed. In addition, IMM banks need to
conduct backtesting that is designed to test the key assumptions of the
EPE model and the relevant risk measures, eg the modelled relationship
between tenors of the same risk factor, and the modelled relationships
between risk factors.
 Significant differences between realised exposures and the forecast
distribution could indicate a problem with the model or the underlying data
that the supervisor would require the bank to correct. Under such
circumstances, supervisors may require additional capital to be held while
the problem is being solved.
 The performance of EPE models and its risk measures must be subject to
good backtesting practice. The backtesting programme must be capable of
identifying poor performance in an EPE model’s risk measures.
50 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 59 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
 Banks must validate their EPE models and all relevant risk measures out to
time horizons commensurate with the maturity of trades for which exposure
is calculated using an internal modelling method.
 The pricing models used to calculate counterparty exposure must be
regularly tested against appropriate independent benchmarks as part of the
on-going model validation process.
 The on-going validation of a bank’s EPE model and the relevant risk
measures include an assessment of recent performance.
 The frequency with which the parameters of an EPE model are updated
needs to be assessed as part of the validation process.
 Under the IMM, a measure that is more conservative than the metric used
to calculate regulatory EAD for every counterparty, may be used in place of
alpha times Effective EPE with the prior approval of the supervisor. The
degree of relative conservatism will be assessed upon initial supervisory
approval and at the regular supervisory reviews of the EPE models. The
bank must validate the conservatism regularly.
 The on-going assessment of model performance needs to cover all
counterparties for which the models are used.
 The validation of IMM models must assess whether or not the bank level
and netting set exposure calculations of EPE are appropriate.
49(i). The bank must have an independent risk control unit that is responsible for
the design and implementation of the bank’s counterparty credit risk management
system. The unit should produce and analyse daily reports on the output of the
bank’s risk measurement model, including an evaluation of the relationship between
measures of counterparty credit exposure and trading limits. The unit must be
independent from the business trading units and should report directly to senior
management of the bank.
B. Addressing reliance on external credit ratings and minimising cliff effects
1. Standardised inferred rating treatment for long-term exposures
118. Para. 99 of the Basel II text would be modified as follows:
99. Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an issue-specific
assessment, the risk weight of the claim will be based on this assessment. Where
the bank’s claim is not an investment in a specific assessed issue, the following
general principles apply.
 In circumstances where the borrower has a specific assessment for an
issued debt – but the bank’s claim is not an investment in this particular
debt – a high quality credit assessment (one which maps into a risk weight
lower than that which applies to an unrated claim) on that specific debt may
only be applied to the bank’s unassessed claim if this claim ranks pari
passu or senior to the claim with an assessment in all respects. If not, the
credit assessment cannot be used and the unassessed claim will receive
the risk weight for unrated claims.
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 51

--- Page 60 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
 In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer assessment, this
assessment typically applies to senior unsecured claims on that issuer.
Consequently, only senior claims on that issuer will benefit from a high
quality issuer assessment. Other unassessed claims of a highly assessed
issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer or a single issue has a
low quality assessment (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than
that which applies to unrated claims), an unassessed claim on the same
counterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior
unsecured issuer assessment or the exposure assessment will be assigned
the same risk weight as is applicable to the low quality assessment.
2. Incentive to avoid getting exposures rated
119. Para. 733 of the Basel II text will read as follows:
733. Credit risk: Banks should have methodologies that enable them to assess
the credit risk involved in exposures to individual borrowers or counterparties as well
as at the portfolio level. Banks should assess exposures, regardless of whether they
are rated or unrated, and determine whether the risk weights applied to such
exposures, under the Standardised Approach, are appropriate for their inherent risk.
In those instances where a bank determines that the inherent risk of such an
exposure, particularly if it is unrated, is significantly higher than that implied by the
risk weight to which it is assigned, the bank should consider the higher degree of
credit risk in the evaluation of its overall capital adequacy. For more sophisticated
banks, the credit review assessment of capital adequacy, at a minimum, should
cover four areas: risk rating systems, portfolio analysis/aggregation,
securitisation/complex credit derivatives, and large exposures and risk
concentrations.
3. Incorporation of IOSCO’s Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating
Agencies
120. Paragraph 91 and 565(b) of the Basel II text will read as follows (paragraph 90 does
not need additional changes):
1. The recognition process
90. National supervisors are responsible for determining on a continuous basis
whether an external credit assessment institution (ECAI) meets the criteria listed in
the paragraph below. National supervisors should refer to the IOSCO Code of
Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies when determining ECAI
eligibility. The assessments of ECAIs may be recognised on a limited basis, e.g. by
type of claims or by jurisdiction. The supervisory process for recognising ECAIs
should be made public to avoid unnecessary barriers to entry.
2. Eligibility criteria
91. An ECAI must satisfy each of the following six criteria.
 Objectivity: no change suggested
 Independence: no change suggested
 International access/Transparency: The individual assessments, the key
elements underlining the assessments and whether the issuer participated
in the assessment process should be publicly available on a non-selective
52 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
basis, unless they are private assessments. In addition, the general
procedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at assessments
used by the ECAI should be publicly available.
 Disclosure: An ECAI should disclose the following information: its code of
conduct; the general nature of its compensation arrangements with
assessed entities; its assessment methodologies, including the definition of
default, the time horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default
rates experienced in each assessment category; and the transitions of the
assessments, e.g. the likelihood of AA ratings becoming A over time.
 Resources: no change suggested
 Credibility: no change suggested
3. Operational requirements for use of external credit assessments
565. The following operational criteria concerning the use of external credit
assessments apply in the standardised and IRB approaches of the securitisation
framework:
(a) no change
(b) The external credit assessments must be from an eligible ECAI as
recognised by the bank’s national supervisor in accordance with paragraphs 90 to
108 with the following exception. In contrast with bullet three of paragraph 91, an
eligible credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions, and the key
elements underlining the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective
basis and free of charge.46 In other words, a rating must be published in an
accessible form and included in the ECAI’s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash-
flow analysis as well as sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying ratings
assumptions should be publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are made
available only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement.
(c) to (f) no change
4. “Cliff effects” arising from guarantees and credit derivatives - Credit risk
mitigation (CRM)
Standardised Approach - Range of eligible guarantors (counter-guarantors)/protection
providers
195. Credit protection given by the following entities will be recognised:
 sovereign entities, PSEs, banks, and securities firms with a lower risk
weight than the counterparty.
 other entities that are externally rated except when credit protection is
provided to a securitisation exposure. This would include credit protection
provided by parent, subsidiary and affiliate companies when they have a
lower risk weight than the obligor.
46 Where the eligible credit assessment is not provided free of charge the ECAI should provide an adequate
justification, within their own publicly available Code of Conduct, in accordance with the 'comply or explain'
nature of the IOSCO Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies.

 when credit protection is provided to a securitisation exposure, other
entities that currently are externally rated BBB- or better and that were
externally rated A- or better at the time the credit protection was provided.
This would include credit protection provided by parent, subsidiary and
affiliate companies when they have a lower risk weight than the obligor.
Recognition under the Foundation IRB approach
302. For banks using the foundation approach for LGD, the approach to
guarantees and credit derivatives closely follows the treatment under the
standardised approach as specified in paragraphs 189 to 201. The range of eligible
guarantors is the same as under the standardised approach except that companies
that are internally rated may also be recognised under the foundation approach. To
receive recognition, the requirements outlined in paragraphs 189 to 194 must be
met.
5. Unsolicited ratings and recognition of ECAIs
121. Paragraph 94 and 108 of the Basel II text will be modified as follows:
94. Banks must use the chosen ECAIs and their ratings consistently for each
type of claim, for both risk weighting and risk management purposes. Banks will not
be allowed to “cherry-pick” the assessments provided by different ECAIs and to
arbitrarily change the use of ECAIs.
108. As a general rule, banks should use solicited ratings from eligible ECAIs.
National supervisory authorities may, however, allow banks to use unsolicited
ratings in the same way as solicited ratings if they are satisfied that the credit
assessments of unsolicited ratings are not inferior in quality to the general quality of
solicited ratings. However, there may be the potential for ECAIs to use unsolicited
ratings to put pressure on entities to obtain solicited ratings. Such behaviour, when
identified, should cause supervisors to consider whether to continue recognising
such ECAIs as eligible for capital adequacy purposes.
III. Capital conservation buffer
122. This section outlines the operation of the capital conservation buffer, which is
designed to ensure that banks build up capital buffers outside periods of stress which can be
drawn down as losses are incurred. The requirement is based on simple capital conservation
rules designed to avoid breaches of minimum capital requirements.
A. Capital conservation best practice
123. Outside of periods of stress, banks should hold buffers of capital above the
regulatory minimum.
124. When buffers have been drawn down, one way banks should look to rebuild them is
through reducing discretionary distributions of earnings. This could include reducing dividend
payments, share-backs and staff bonus payments. Banks may also choose to raise new
capital from the private sector as an alternative to conserving internally generated capital.
54 Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems

--- Page 63 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
The balance between these options should be discussed with supervisors as part of the
capital planning process.
125. It is clear that greater efforts should be made to rebuild buffers the more they have
been depleted. Therefore, in the absence of raising capital in the private sector, the share of
earnings retained by banks for the purpose of rebuilding their capital buffers should increase
the nearer their actual capital levels are to the minimum capital requirement.
126. It is not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to use future
predictions of recovery as justification for maintaining generous distributions to shareholders,
other capital providers and employees. These stakeholders, rather than depositors, must
bear the risk that recovery will not be forthcoming.
127. It is also not acceptable for banks which have depleted their capital buffers to try
and use the distribution of capital as a way to signal their financial strength. Not only is this
irresponsible from the perspective of an individual bank, putting shareholders interests above
depositors, it may also encourage other banks to follow suit. As a consequence, banks in
aggregate can end up increasing distributions at the exact point in time when they should be
conserving earnings.
128. The framework reduces the discretion of banks which have depleted their capital
buffers to further reduce them through generous distributions of earnings. In doing so, the
framework will strengthen their ability to withstand adverse environments. Implementation of
the framework through internationally agreed capital conservation rules will help increase
sector resilience both going into a downturn, and provide the mechanism for rebuilding
capital during the early stages of economic recovery. Retaining a greater proportion of
earnings during a downturn will help ensure that capital remains available to support the
ongoing business operations of banks through the period of stress. In this way the framework
should help reduce procyclicality.
B. The framework
129. A capital conservation buffer of 2.5%, comprised of Common Equity Tier 1, is
established above the regulatory minimum capital requirement.47 Capital distribution
constraints will be imposed on a bank when capital levels fall within this range. Banks will be
able to conduct business as normal when their capital levels fall into the conservation range
as they experience losses. The constraints imposed only relate to distributions, not the
operation of the bank.
130. The distribution constraints imposed on banks when their capital levels fall into the
range increase as the banks’ capital levels approach the minimum requirements. By design,
the constraints imposed on banks with capital levels at the top of the range would be
minimal. This reflects an expectation that banks’ capital levels will from time to time fall into
this range. The Basel Committee does not wish to impose constraints for entering the range
that would be so restrictive as to result in the range being viewed as establishing a new
minimum capital requirement.
47 Common Equity Tier 1 must first be used to meet the minimum capital requirements (including the 6% Tier 1
and 8% Total capital requirements if necessary), before the remainder can contribute to the capital
conservation buffer.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
131. The table below shows the minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at
various levels of the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratios. For example, a bank with a
CET1 capital ratio in the range of 5.125% to 5.75% is required to conserve 80% of its
earnings in the subsequent financial year (ie payout no more than 20% in terms of dividends,
share buybacks and discretionary bonus payments). If the bank wants to make payments in
excess of the constraints imposed by this regime, it would have the option of raising capital in
the private sector equal to the amount above the constraint which it wishes to distribute. This
would be discussed with the bank’s supervisor as part of the capital planning process. The
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio includes amounts used to meet the 4.5% minimum Common
Equity Tier 1 requirement, but excludes any additional Common Equity Tier 1 needed to
meet the 6% Tier 1 and 8% Total Capital requirements. For example, a bank with 8% CET1
and no Additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital would meet all minimum capital requirements, but
would have a zero conservation buffer and therefore by subject to the 100% constraint on
capital distributions.
Individual bank minimum capital conservation standards
Minimum Capital Conservation Ratios
Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio
(expressed as a percentage of earnings)
4.5% - 5.125% 100%
>5.125% - 5.75% 80%
>5.75% - 6.375% 60%
>6.375% - 7.0% 40%
> 7.0% 0%
132. Set out below are a number of other key aspects of the requirements:
(a) Elements subject to the restriction on distributions: Items considered to be
distributions include dividends and share buybacks, discretionary payments on
other Tier 1 capital instruments and discretionary bonus payments to staff.
Payments that do not result in a depletion of Common Equity Tier 1, which may for
example include certain scrip dividends, are not considered distributions.
(b) Definition of earnings: Earnings are defined as distributable profits calculated prior
to the deduction of elements subject to the restriction on distributions. Earnings are
calculated after the tax which would have been reported had none of the
distributable items been paid. As such, any tax impact of making such distributions
are reversed out. Where a bank does not have positive earnings and has a
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio less than 7%, it would be restricted from making
positive net distributions.
(c) Solo or consolidated application: The framework should be applied at the
consolidated level, ie restrictions would be imposed on distributions out of the
consolidated group. National supervisors would have the option of applying the
regime at the solo level to conserve resources in specific parts of the group.
(d) Additional supervisory discretion: Although the buffer must be capable of being
drawn down, banks should not choose in normal times to operate in the buffer
range simply to compete with other banks and win market share. To ensure that this
does not happen, supervisors have the additional discretion to impose time limits on
banks operating within the buffer range on a case-by-case basis. In any case,

--- Page 65 ---

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
supervisors should ensure that the capital plans of banks seek to rebuild buffers
over an appropriate timeframe.
C. Transitional arrangements
133. The capital conservation buffer will be phased in between 1 January 2016 and year
end 2018 becoming fully effective on 1 January 2019. It will begin at 0.625% of RWAs on
1 January 2016 and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625 percentage
points, to reach its final level of 2.5% of RWAs on 1 January 2019. Countries that experience
excessive credit growth should consider accelerating the build up of the capital conservation
buffer and the countercyclical buffer. National authorities have the discretion to impose
shorter transition periods and should do so where appropriate.
134. Banks that already meet the minimum ratio requirement during the transition period
but remain below the 7% Common Equity Tier 1 target (minimum plus conservation buffer)
should maintain prudent earnings retention policies with a view to meeting the conservation
buffer as soon as reasonably possible.
135. The division of the buffer into quartiles that determine the minimum capital
conservation ratios will begin on 1 January 2016. These quartiles will expand as the capital
conservation buffer is phased in and will take into account any countercyclical buffer in effect
during this period.
IV. Countercyclical buffer
A. Introduction
136. Losses incurred in the banking sector can be extremely large when a downturn is
preceded by a period of excess credit growth. These losses can destabilise the banking
sector and spark a vicious circle, whereby problems in the financial system can contribute to
a downturn in the real economy that then feeds back on to the banking sector. These
interactions highlight the particular importance of the banking sector building up additional
capital defences in periods where the risks of system-wide stress are growing markedly.
137. The countercyclical buffer aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements
take account of the macro-financial environment in which banks operate. It will be deployed
by national jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with
a build-up of system-wide risk to ensure the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect
it against future potential losses. This focus on excess aggregate credit growth means that
jurisdictions are likely to only need to deploy the buffer on an infrequent basis. The buffer for
internationally-active banks will be a weighted average of the buffers deployed across all the
jurisdictions to which it has credit exposures. This means that they will likely find themselves
subject to a small buffer on a more frequent basis, since credit cycles are not always highly
correlated across jurisdictions.
138. The countercyclical buffer regime consists of the following elements:
(a) National authorities will monitor credit growth and other indicators that may signal a
build up of system-wide risk and make assessments of whether credit growth is
excessive and is leading to the build up of system-wide risk. Based on this
assessment they will put in place a countercyclical buffer requirement when
Basel III: A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems 57

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
circumstances warrant. This requirement will be released when system-wide risk
crystallises or dissipates.
(b) Internationally active banks will look at the geographic location of their private
sector credit exposures and calculate their bank specific countercyclical capital
buffer requirement as a weighted average of the requirements that are being
applied in jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.
(c) The countercyclical buffer requirement to which a bank is subject will extend the
size of the capital conservation buffer. Banks will be subject to restrictions on
distributions if they do not meet the requirement.
B. National countercyclical buffer requirements
139. Each Basel Committee member jurisdiction will identify an authority with the
responsibility to make decisions on the size of the countercyclical capital buffer. If the
relevant national authority judges a period of excess credit growth to be leading to the build
up of system-wide risk, they will consider, together with any other macroprudential tools at
their disposal, putting in place a countercyclical buffer requirement. This will vary between
zero and 2.5% of risk weighted assets, depending on their judgement as to the extent of the
build up of system-wide risk.48
140. The document entitled Guidance for national authorities operating the
countercyclical capital buffer, sets out the principles that national authorities have agreed to
follow in making buffer decisions. This document provides information that should help banks
to understand and anticipate the buffer decisions made by national authorities in the
jurisdictions to which they have credit exposures.
141. To give banks time to adjust to a buffer level, a jurisdiction will pre-announce its
decision to raise the level of the countercyclical buffer by up to 12 months.49 Decisions by a
jurisdiction to decrease the level of the countercyclical buffer will take effect immediately.
The pre-announced buffer decisions and the actual buffers in place for all Committee
member jurisdictions will be published on the BIS website.
C. Bank specific countercyclical buffer
142. Banks will be subject to a countercyclical buffer that varies between zero and 2.5%
to total risk weighted assets.50 The buffer that will apply to each bank will reflect the
geographic composition of its portfolio of credit exposures. Banks must meet this buffer with
48 National authorities can implement a range of additional macroprudential tools, including a buffer in excess of
2.5% for banks in their jurisdiction, if this is deemed appropriate in their national context. However, the
international reciprocity provisions set out in this regime treat the maximum countercyclical buffer as 2.5%.
49 Banks outside of this jurisdiction with credit exposures to counterparties in this jurisdiction will also be subject
to the increased buffer level after the pre-announcement period in respect of these exposures. However, in
cases where the pre-announcement period of a jurisdiction is shorter than 12 months, the home authority of
such banks should seek to match the preannouncement period where practical, or as soon as possible
(subject to a maximum preannouncement period of 12 months), before the new buffer level comes into effect.
50 As with the capital conservation buffer, the framework will be applied at the consolidated level. In addition,
national supervisors may apply the regime at the solo level to conserve resources in specific parts of the
group.

Common Equity Tier 1 or other fully loss absorbing capital51 or be subject to the restrictions
on distributions set out in the next Section.
143. Internationally active banks will look at the geographic location of their private sector
credit exposures (including non-bank financial sector exposures) and calculate their
countercyclical capital buffer requirement as a weighted average of the buffers that are being
applied in jurisdictions to which they have an exposure. Credit exposures in this case include
all private sector credit exposures that attract a credit risk capital charge or the risk weighted
equivalent trading book capital charges for specific risk, IRC and securitisation.
144. The weighting applied to the buffer in place in each jurisdiction will be the bank’s
total credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposures in that jurisdiction52,
divided by the bank’s total credit risk charge that relates to private sector credit exposures
across all jurisdictions.
145. For the VaR for specific risk, the incremental risk charge and the comprehensive risk
measurement charge, banks should work with their supervisors to develop an approach that
would translate these charges into individual instrument risk weights that would then be
allocated to the geographic location of the specific counterparties that make up the charge.
However, it may not always be possible to break down the charges in this way due to the
charges being calculated on a portfolio by portfolio basis. In such cases, the charge for the
relevant portfolio should be allocated to the geographic regions of the constituents of the
portfolio by calculating the proportion of the portfolio’s total exposure at default (EAD) that is
due to the EAD resulting from counterparties in each geographic region.
D. Extension of the capital conservation buffer
146. The countercyclical buffer requirement to which a bank is subject is implemented
through an extension of the capital conservation buffer described in section III.
147. The table below shows the minimum capital conservation ratios a bank must meet at
various levels of the Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio.53 When the countercyclical capital
buffer is zero in all of the regions to which a bank has private sector credit exposures, the
capital levels and restrictions set out in the table are the same as those set out in section III.
51 The Committee is still reviewing the question of permitting other fully loss absorbing capital beyond Common
Equity Tier 1 and what form it would take. Until the Committee has issued further guidance, the countercyclical
buffer is to be met with Common Equity Tier 1 only.
52 When considering the jurisdiction to which a private sector credit exposure relates, banks should use, where
possible, an ultimate risk basis; i.e. it should use the country where the guarantor of the exposure resides, not
where the exposure has been booked.
53 Consistent with the conservation buffer, the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio in this context includes amounts used
to meet the 4.5% minimum Common Equity Tier 1 requirement, but excludes any additional Common Equity
Tier 1 needed to meet the 6% Tier 1 and 8% Total Capital requirements.

> 9.5% 0%
E. Frequency of calculation and disclosure
149. Banks must ensure that their countercyclical buffer requirements are calculated and
publically disclosed with at least the same frequency as their minimum capital requirements.
The buffer should be based on the latest relevant jurisdictional countercyclical buffers that
are available at the date that they calculate their minimum capital requirement. In addition,
when disclosing their buffer requirement, banks must also disclose the geographic
breakdown of their private sector credit exposures used in the calculation of the buffer
requirement.
F. Transitional arrangements
150. The countercyclical buffer regime will be phased-in in parallel with the capital
conservation buffer between 1 January 2016 and year end 2018 becoming fully effective on
1 January 2019. This means that the maximum countercyclical buffer requirement will begin
at 0.625% of RWAs on 1 January 2016 and increase each subsequent year by an additional
0.625 percentage points, to reach its final maximum of 2.5% of RWAs on 1 January 2019.
Countries that experience excessive credit growth during this transition period will consider
accelerating the build up of the capital conservation buffer and the countercyclical buffer. In
addition, jurisdictions may choose to implement larger countercyclical buffer requirements. In
such cases the reciprocity provisions of the regime will not apply to the additional amounts or
earlier time-frames.

V. Leverage ratio
A. Rationale and objective
151. One of the underlying features of the crisis was the build-up of excessive on- and
off-balance sheet leverage in the banking system. In many cases, banks built up excessive
leverage while still showing strong risk based capital ratios. During the most severe part of
the crisis, the banking sector was forced by the market to reduce its leverage in a manner
that amplified downward pressure on asset prices, further exacerbating the positive feedback
loop between losses, declines in bank capital, and contraction in credit availability.
152. Therefore, the Committee agreed to introduce a simple, transparent, non-risk based
leverage ratio that is calibrated to act as a credible supplementary measure to the risk based
capital requirements. The leverage ratio is intended to achieve the following objectives:
 constrain the build-up of leverage in the banking sector, helping avoid destabilising
deleveraging processes which can damage the broader financial system and the
economy; and
 reinforce the risk based requirements with a simple, non-risk based “backstop”
measure.
B. Definition and calculation of the leverage ratio
153. This section presents the definition and calculation of the leverage ratio, which
would serve as the basis for testing during the parallel run period. The basis of calculation is
the average of the monthly leverage ratio over the quarter based on the definitions of capital
(the capital measure) and total exposure (the exposure measure) specified in paragraphs
154 to 164. The Committee will test a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% during the parallel
run period from 1 January 2013 to 1 January 2017. Additional transitional arrangements are
set out in paragraphs 165 to 167.
1. Capital measure
154. The capital measure for the leverage ratio should be based on the new definition of
Tier 1 capital as set out in paragraphs 52 to 56 of this Framework. The Committee also will
collect data during the transition period to track the impact of using total regulatory capital
and Common Equity Tier 1.
155. Items that are deducted completely from capital do not contribute to leverage, and
should therefore also be deducted from the measure of exposure. That is, the capital and
exposure should be measured consistently and should avoid double counting. This means
that deductions from Tier 1 capital (as set out in paragraphs 66 to 89) should also be made
from the exposure measure.
156. According to the treatment outlined in paragraphs 84 to 89, where a financial entity
is included in the accounting consolidation but not in the regulatory consolidation, the
investments in the capital of these entities are required to be deducted to the extent that that
they exceed certain thresholds. To ensure that the capital and exposure are measured
consistently for the purposes of the leverage ratio, the assets of such entities included in the
accounting consolidation should be excluded from the exposure measure in proportion to the
capital that is excluded under paragraphs 84 to 89.

2. Exposure measure
(i) General measurement principles
157. The exposure measure for the leverage ratio should generally follow the accounting
measure of exposure. To be measured consistently with financial accounts, the following
should apply:
 on-balance sheet, non-derivative exposures are net of specific provisions and
valuation adjustments (eg credit valuation adjustments);
 physical or financial collateral, guarantees or credit risk mitigation purchased is not
allowed to reduce on-balance sheet exposures; and
 netting of loans and deposits is not allowed.
(ii) On-balance sheet items
158. Banks should include items using their accounting balance sheet for the purposes of
the leverage ratio. In addition, the exposure measure should include the following treatments
for Securities Financing Transactions (SFT)54 and derivatives.
(a) Repurchase agreements and securities finance
159. SFT are a form of secured funding and therefore an important source of balance
sheet leverage that should be included in the leverage ratio. Therefore, banks should
calculate SFT for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:
 the accounting measure of exposure; and
 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework.55
(b) Derivatives
160. Derivatives create two types of exposure: an “on-balance sheet” present value
reflecting the fair value of the contract (often zero at outset but subsequently positive or
negative depending on the performance of the contract), and a notional economic exposure
representing the underlying economic interest of the contract.
161. Banks should calculate derivatives, including where a bank sells protection using a
credit derivative, for the purposes of the leverage ratio by applying:
 the accounting measure of exposure plus an add-on for potential future exposure
calculated according to the Current Exposure Method as identified in paragraphs
186, 187 and 317 of the Basel II Framework. This ensures that all derivatives are
converted in a consistent manner to a “loan equivalent” amount; and
 the regulatory netting rules based on the Basel II Framework.56
54 Securities Financing Transactions are transactions such as repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase
agreements, security lending and borrowing, and margin lending transactions, where the value of the
transactions depends on the market valuations and the transactions are often subject to margin agreements.
55 Excepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3.
56 Excepting the rules for cross-product netting in Annex 4, section 3.

Note: Basel III revisions published in December 2017 affect parts of this publication. https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d424.htm
(iii) Off-balance sheet items
162. This section relates to off-balance sheet (OBS) items in paragraphs 82-83,
(including 83(i)), 84(i-iii), 85-86, and 88-89) of the Basel II Framework. These include
commitments (including liquidity facilities), unconditionally cancellable commitments, direct
credit substitutes, acceptances, standby letters of credit, trade letters of credit, failed
transactions and unsettled securities. The treatment of the items included in 83(ii) and 84, ie
repurchase agreements and securities financing transactions is addressed above.
163. The Committee recognises that OBS items are a source of potentially significant
leverage. Therefore, banks should calculate the above OBS items for the purposes of the
leverage ratio by applying a uniform 100% credit conversion factor (CCF).
164. For any commitments that are unconditionally cancellable at any time by the bank
without prior notice, banks should apply a CCF of 10%. The Committee will conduct further
review to ensure that the 10% CCF is appropriately conservative based on historical
experience.
C. Transitional arrangements
165. The transition period for the leverage ratio will commence 1 January 2011. The
Committee will use the transition period to monitor banks’ leverage data on a semi-annual
basis in order to assess whether the proposed design and calibration of the minimum Tier 1
leverage ratio of 3% is appropriate over a full credit cycle and for different types of business
models. This assessment will include consideration of whether a wider definition of
exposures and an offsetting adjustment in the calibration would better achieve the objectives
of the leverage ratio. The Committee also will closely monitor accounting standards and
practices to address any differences in national accounting frameworks that are material to
the definition and calculation of the leverage ratio.
166. The transition period will comprise of a supervisory monitoring period and a parallel
run period:
 The supervisory monitoring period commences 1 January 2011. The supervisory
monitoring process will focus on developing templates to track in a consistent
manner the underlying components of the agreed definition and resulting ratio.
 The parallel run period commences 1 January 2013 and runs until 1 January 2017.
During this period, the leverage ratio and its components will be tracked, including
its behaviour relative to the risk based requirement. Banks are required to calculate
their leverage ratio using the definitions of capital and total exposure specified in
paragraphs 154 to 164 and their risk based capital requirement. Bank level
disclosure of the leverage ratio and its components will start 1 January 2015.57 The
Committee will develop a disclosure template and closely monitor disclosure of the
ratio.
167. Based on the results of the parallel run period, any final adjustments to the definition
and calibration of the leverage ratio will be carried out in the first half of 2017, with a view to
migrating to a Pillar 1 treatment on 1 January 2018 based on appropriate review and
calibration.
57 Consistent with the scope of application as defined in paragraph 22 of the Basel II Framework.

Annex 2
The 15% of common equity limit on specified items
1. This Annex is meant to clarify the calculation of the 15% limit on significant
investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial institutions (banks, insurance
and other financial entities); mortgage servicing rights, and deferred tax assets arising from
temporary differences (collectively referred to as specified items).
2. The recognition of these specified items will be limited to 15% of Common Equity
Tier 1 (CET1) capital, after the application of all deductions. To determine the maximum
amount of the specified items that can be recognised*, banks and supervisors should
multiply the amount of CET1** (after all deductions, including after the deduction of the
specified items in full) by 17.65%. This number is derived from the proportion of 15% to 85%
(ie 15%/85% = 17.65%).
3. As an example, take a bank with €85 of common equity (calculated net of all
deductions, including after the deduction of the specified items in full).
4. The maximum amount of specified items that can be recognised by this bank in its
calculation of CET1 capital is €85 x 17.65% = €15. Any excess above €15 must be deducted
from CET1. If the bank has specified items (excluding amounts deducted after applying the
individual 10% limits) that in aggregate sum up to the 15% limit, CET1 after inclusion of the
specified items, will amount to €85 + €15 = €100. The percentage of specified items to total
CET1 would equal 15%.
* The actual amount that will be recognised may be lower than this maximum, either because the sum
of the three specified items are below the 15% limit set out in this annex, or due to the application of
the 10% limit applied to each item.
** At this point this is a "hypothetical" amount of CET1 in that it is used only for the purposes of
determining the deduction of the specified items.

Annex 3
Minority interest illustrative example
This Annex illustrates the treatment of minority interest and other capital issued out of
subsidiaries to third parties, which is set out in paragraphs 62 to 64.
Illustrative example
A banking group consists of two legal entities that are both banks. Bank P is the parent and
Bank S is the subsidiary and their unconsolidated balance sheets are set out below.
Bank P balance sheet Bank S balance sheet
Assets Assets
Loans to customers 100 Loans to customers 150
Investment in CET1 of Bank S 7
Investment in the AT1 of Bank S 4
Investment in the T2 of Bank S 2
Liabilities and equity Liabilities and equity
Depositors 70 Depositors 127
Tier 2 10 Tier 2 8
Additional Tier 1 7 Additional Tier 1 5
Common equity 26 Common equity 10
The balance sheet of Bank P shows that in addition to its loans to customers, it owns 70% of
the common shares of Bank S, 80% of the Additional Tier 1 of Bank S and 25% of the Tier 2
capital of Bank S. The ownership of the capital of Bank S is therefore as follows:
Capital issued by Bank S
Amount issued Amount issued Total
to parent to third parties
(Bank P)
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) 7 3 10
Additional Tier 1 (AT1) 4 1 5
Tier 1 (T1) 11 4 15
Tier 2 (T2) 2 6 8
Total capital (TC) 13 10 23
The consolidated balance sheet of the banking group is set out below:

Consolidated balance sheet
Assets
Loans to customers 250
Liabilities and equity
Depositors 197
Tier 2 issued by subsidiary to third parties 6
Tier 2 issued by parent 10
Additional Tier 1 issued by subsidiary to third parties 1
Additional Tier 1 issued by parent 7
Common equity issued by subsidiary to third parties (ie minority interest) 3
Common equity issued by parent 26
For illustrative purposes Bank S is assumed to have risk weighted assets of 100. In this
example, the minimum capital requirements of Bank S and the subsidiary’s contribution to
the consolidated requirements are the same since Bank S does not have any loans to Bank
P. This means that it is subject to the following minimum plus capital conservation buffer
requirements and has the following surplus capital:
Minimum and surplus capital of Bank S
Minimum plus capital Surplus
conservation buffer
CET1 7.0 3.0
(= 7.0% of 100) (=10 – 7.0)
T1 8.5 6.5
(= 8.5% of 100) (=10 + 5 – 8.5)
TC 10.5 12.5
(= 10.5% of 100) (=10 + 5 + 8 – 10.5)
The following table illustrates how to calculate the amount of capital issued by Bank S to
include in consolidated capital, following the calculation procedure set out in paragraphs 62
to 65:

The following table summarises the components of capital for the consolidated group based
on the amounts calculated in the table above. Additional Tier 1 is calculated as the difference
between Common Equity Tier 1 and Tier 1 and Tier 2 is the difference between Total Capital
and Tier 1.

be included in parties to be included in be included in
